"Like to have you 'round  
With all the lies that you make  
The things or darkness and you  
Some people say, have just a taste  
Right or wrong, you might get burned  
What you gain is what you learn  
  
Got one too many women  
Don't know quite which way to go  
They're all gettin' so expensive  
When they walk by themselves  
Right or wrong, don't regret  
What you went for is what you get  
  
No point in bitter tears  
When someone else has cut you down  
'Cause there's a time for leavin'  
And there's a time for stickin' around, hey  
Right or wrong, you've got to live  
So what you collect is what you give

"She says she's no good with words but I'm worse  
Barely stuttered out  
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue  
And weighed down with words too overdramatic  
Tonight it's ""it can't get much worse""  
Vs. ""no one should ever feel like..""  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by

We're falling apart to half time  
Dance, dance  
And these are the lives you love to lead  
Dance this is the way they'd look  
If they knew how misery loved me  
  
  
You always fold just before you're found out  
Drink up its last call  
Last resort  
But only the first mistake and I  
  
I'm two quarters and a heart down  
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds  
These words are all I have so I write them  
I need them just to get by  
  
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine  
You've been saving for his mattress (love)

The more I understand the ride, the more I slide  
The more you put me back in line, the more I tried  
The more you looked into my eyes, the more you lied

You come back crazier, you'll feel better

"I'm being dragged down, down by the hand  
The hand of a golden giant man  
He's crushing my knuckles  
Splitting my skin, he says he will  
If only I'd ask it of him  
  
He says  
Girl, it's your call  
You wanna fly  
You wanna fall  
So I shout  
I wanna get away from you  
As fast as I can  
I tell my feet to move it  
I hope they have a plan

These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Are heading the right way  
These little black sandals  
Are walking me away  
These little black sandals  
Saved my life today  
  
So now I'm free  
Free  
From the big bad giant  
  
Who was stalking me  
Thank you feet, for guiding me  
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I'm tempted  
Sometimes I am  
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man  
He was the line between pleasure and pain  
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim

"In my dreams an old friend came to see you  
Right from the start he was the stealing kind  
You'll never know how much it hurt me darling  
The night you left his loving on your mind

Then and only then you're really mine  
There's sadness when you go away and I face another day  
Yet I keep dreaming of you all the time

Last night again I dreamed we were together  
I held you close the way I used to do  
I kissed your lips and said I found my heaven  
You whispered low how much you love me too

"Beating with life you promised life,  
Security, happiness.  
Unfortunate son cornered,  
Cowering in the pit of  
Circling panes of glass that  
Surround and reveal the ever present ""It"".  
  
""It"" is my move, my every look,  
Interpreting gestures,  
Informing other  
What's undercover and  
Lurking beneath my mask  
Of this year's featured model.  
Is this too much?  
Close your eyes.  
Care to look inside? I am I!  
  
What may appear  
Might easily be explained,  
But given the situation  
Of info saturation,  
What you feel can never go away.  
  
Steering perception? I am!  
Inviting contradiction? I am!  
It's my insistence  
You keep your distance  
From the glare behind my stare.  
So this is the way  
The game is played.  
You can leave now...  
But I think you'll stay. I am I!

Central Park last week  
The fathers are lined up by  
the coffins by the Statue of Bigotry  
You better hold on something's happening here  
You better hold on---meet you in Tompkins Square

They shot him in the car where he sat  
And Eleanor Bumpres and Michael Stewart must have appreciated that  
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague of bloody vials  
washing up on the beach  
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson  
to heal this bloody breach  
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer  
she'll never dance but the baby was saved  
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel  
and he doesn't even remember a thing  
They shot that old lady  
'cause they thought she was a witness  
to a crime she didn't even see  
Whose home is the home of the brave by the Statue of Bigotry  
You got a black .38 and a gravity knife  
You still have to ride the train  
There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there  
but you ain't no Bernard Goetz  
There's no Mafia lawyer  
to fight in your corner  
for that 15 minutes of fame

But I can see the reason, it's just your way of teasin'  
But my, oh, my, my, my, I'll take it all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The only place where we can be alone  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
To hold you close this way, you say is wrong  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
If you don't stop, our love just can't go on  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
Why can't we let the night just linger on

But you act like I'm alright is something I just can't do  
Something I just can't do

So, something I just can't do  
What if I could, I'm just not strong enough to, whoa

Keep lying to you, babe,  
I'm just not strong enough to, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl  
  
I can see you looking at me,  
You're thinking too little too late  
Cause it was me that said that we shouldn't be  
But that was before I could think straight  
My pride, it made me lie, lie, lie  
To you and to myself about what I need  
So now I walk around with this lie, truly dying inside  
Acting like I'm just fine, it's something I just can't do  
Something just I can't do, keep pretending  
That I'm okay without, just said something I just can't do  
Something I just can't do  
What if could I'm just no strong enough to, whoa  
Not strong enough to who  
Keep lying to you, babe,  
I'm just not strong enough to, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

I'm gonna be true to you  
Cause me trying to deny that without you I would die  
Something I just can no longer do

Everything could be so right if I was your lover  
  
Another day goes by and I'd lose my mind  
If I didn't know that you were meant for me  
Under moonlit night, when the time is right  
You'll hold me in your arms from then on to infinity  
  
And every night I'll dream (I dream)

I wish I could give you something you didn't owe  
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile

Find an old time movie where we don't know the end  
Lost in the radio, drive another mile

Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile

And drown to despise me no more

I thought we had it made  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a long hard road without you  
And there's one thing you should know  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
I really don't want you to go, no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart  
  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why, oh no  
Only love can tear you down  
Only love knows why, oh no  
  
Only love will make you cry

"Once in a life there comes a man like you  
And you bear a son so much like yourself  
And it's hard to believe that he's a grown man  
But pop I understand  
  
Once every night I thank my lucky stars  
You've given me some guiding light  
But there comes a time when a father and a son  
Can no longer be as one  
  
It took me so long to recover  
From the pain of having denied the love I once relied upon  
It takes more than time to discover  
That for both the young and old  
The truth is sometimes cold but right  
  
This is my life  
And I've got to hold my own  
Even if it means hurting us both  
And the wrongs become right when  
We stop and wonder how  
Look at us  
We're better friends now

"Wishful thinking, eyes are blinking,  
In the sun the garbage stinking.  
To ignore the rancid, won't make it go away.  
  
Untruth spoke through blistered lip,  
Unclean thoughts that take the step,  
Down upon the roaches,  
Won't go away.  
  
Born! to follow!  
To be the first to swallow,  
Garbage from the plate.  
Now! to borrow!  
A match, ignite the gasoline,  
To burn away.  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream,  
In the month the razon blade gleam,  
Slashing up the tongue, won't make it go away.  
On a binge of self destruction,  
  
Children of the reconstruction,  
Suck the tit of discontent,  
Go away.  
  
Slam! slam down!  
Respond in kind malcontent,  
Don't go away.  
Burn! burn down!  
  
Temple of the conscience,  
Don't go away.  
  
I was soaked in gasoline,  
Playin' with a match.  
I was everything I seemed,  
They stood and watched.  
  
Ate from your table!  
Ate from your hand!  
Eight days of waiting!  
Buried in the sand!  
  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.  
Take away my dignity, take away my pain,  
Take just for taking, we are one in the same...  
  
Burn... Burn...  
Burn in a gasoline dream, burn away my love.  
Burn away the conscience, burn away, my love.

"Don't feel bad if you wake up feeling suddenly old  
More the realisation that you've let yourself be covered by mould  
Age is not something you wrap up if you're feeling the cold  
It's a laugh ten times harder at a joke eleven times told  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
Don't feel bad if you're feeling past you sell-by date  
Like the roller coaster ride slowed down to a serious debate  
Oh the weather you tell them you're ready or whether you wait  
Does someone place a hand on your shoulder you point the way to the gate  
  
Down to the churchyard, check out the vaults  
Dig up the coffins, unscrew the bolts  
No better reminder, no strong enough salts  
To show this pitiful few that we've missed the last waltz  
  
You don't count the birthdays 'til your out on your own  
They come thicker and faster and too damn late to postpone  
And wisdom's the last thing the scientists willing to clone  
Science advances, maturity dances alone

"You won't believe where I was today  
Something made my car go a different way  
Before I knew it  
I was back in time at our old address  
  
Sitting in the drive  
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves  
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree  
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon  
  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
They added on where we thought we would  
You always said it would sure look good  
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall  
  
Looks like they picked up right where we left off  
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun  
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun  
I could see us there together  
  
Seemed the sky was always blue  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
If I could make one wish  
Oh, I'd relive my life with you

I don't wanna come down  
But no promises he made me could persuade me  
Like the loneliness that comes on when I  
Try to go on without him  
Try to doubt him

And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'

This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up  
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand  
I already know the plan, hop out and get on your mans  
And take what he got  
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots  
This a stick-up  
Phone ring, it's my mama in the middle of some drama  
So I don't pick up thinking I gotta get my shit up  
I gotta pick my bitch up  
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us  
So we left with a thousand dollars cash

"Met a girl in the parking lot,  
And all I did was say hello.  
Her pepper spray made it rather hard  
For me to walk her home,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me again was it love at first sight  
When I walked by and you caught my eye.  
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?  
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.  
  
Met a girl with a graceful charm,  
But when beauty met the beast he froze.  
Got the sense I was not her type  
By a black eye and bloody nose,  
But I guess that's the way it goes.

It's suffocating to say,  
But the female mystique takes my breath away.  
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,  
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.

When I walked by and you caught my eye.

If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.

And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle  
I trample down all life in my wake

Hear machinery roar to my empty sound  
Touch my heart and feel winter

And the bright eyes above

Climbed the highest hill in peru  
Took a walk on the ganges, peeled the wraps of rameses  
Slayed me a dragon or two  
Turned saviors and saints, and little green men

But I never quite saw the light

Through the vast enchanted forest  
  
The surrounding skies are one  
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning  
Rain is pouring down my (now) shivering shoulders  
In the rain my tears are forever lost  
  
The darkened oaks are my only shelter  
Red leaves are blown by the wind  
An ebony raven now catches my eye  
Sitting in calmness  
Before spreading his black wings  
Reaching for the skies  
  
In this forest  
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon

In the form of wisdom  
Carved on a black stone  
The only way to follow

I'd see it as an end to misery  
As an end to worldly pain  
An end to worldly pain ...  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
To end this worldly pain  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
And fly into the sun  
  
The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking  
The stars split to their core  
And every proton and unnamed neutron  
is fusing in my bones  
And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising  
As man burns from his tomb  
And I look at this as a blissful moment  
To fly into the sun  
  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd burn up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun  
To end this mystery answer my mystery  
I'd look at this as a wondrous moment  
To end this mystery  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun

"People, people who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
  
We're children needing other children  
And yet, letting our grown up pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
  
Lovers, are very special people  
They're the luckiest people in the world  
With one person  
One very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul says  
You were half, now you're whole  
  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world

Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults  
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall

Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day.

That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me.

And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling

Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground

It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings  
Yeah love's the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything

Or you get knocked down for nothing

By everyone in this room  
Who'd ever come up short or won a race

And clarity trail distortion

Pay close attention  
To fingerprints in the dust  
And fallen feet that leave no trace

... Out of place  
  
Sincerely now...  
I requested information  
At a roadside station  
Sister it seems absurd  
To be hammering pith  
Like a poet with a loss for words  
Trying to describe an angel's face  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
Wholly in demand  
Coming off second hand

When there's nowhere to go  
Except lawless travel  
And an end to infinity's space  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place

"The sleepless nights  
The daily fights  
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates  
The endless waits  
The lovely loving and the hateful hates  
The conversations with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain  
No no more strain  
Now I'm sane  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
The flying fur of cat and cur  
The fine mismatching of a him and her  
I've learned my lesson but  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The furtive sigh  
The blackened eye  
The words I love you 'til the day I die  
The self-deception that believes that lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals  
It soon reveals  
The faint aroma of performing seals  
The double-crossing of a pair of heels  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more care  
No more despair  
Now I'm all there  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
Believe me sir, I much prefer  
The classic battle of a him and her  
I don't like quiet and I wish I were  
In love again  
In love again

"Go, tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain

While shepherds kept their watching  
Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light.  
  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo! Above the earth  
Rang out the angels chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth.

The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation

Yourself waiting for a long time  
Your back's to the wall  
But now you must go  
Painting scenes from magazines  
Sucking breath from nicotine  
Standing tall against the crowd we sigh  
Taking turns on telephones  
Living lives in other homes  
Listening for the passionate replies  
Suddenly we find  
Ourselves talking for a long time  
Our voices are low  
But now you must know  
Giving all you have to give  
Taking all you've got to live  
Plotting all mistakes along the way  
Find it hard to take it all  
Reading names on other walls  
Writing down the words we tried to sing  
Suddenly you'll find

"Your life stepped lightly out our hands  
When no one's looking out you understand  
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn  
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned  
  
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down  
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground  
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend  
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end  
  
Every new version of the way of life  
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night  
But whose kid are you when they finally decide  
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died  
  
But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell  
The difference for you between heaven and hell  
To glorify something, your legends are found  
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground  
  
Years rolling by just like a dream  
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine  
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone  
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone

",Cold Highway,Elton John
"Even though the night is early there's a fire that whispers hurry  
Darling please turn off the lights and lock the door  
Come lay down here beside me tell me that I'm soft and pretty  
And love me like you never have before  
  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Don't hold back the love you feel inside why should passion be ashamed  
If this is our last time make it last me for a lifetime  
Leave me with enough of sunshine to carry me through the rain  
  
In the morning you'll be leaving but tonight there'll be no grieving  
I'll have lots of time to cry when you're gone  
Let's not waste one precious moment take all of me I'm still your woman  
And love me up until the break of dawn  
  
If this is our last time...

",If This Is Our Last Time,Tina Turner
"Come on now, I'm the one you love  
I'm the one you can't breathe without remember  
Why you wanna make me cry like this?  
Why is you wanna make me cry?  
Why me?  
Your love is like a chunk of gold  
Hard to gain, hard to hold  
Like a rose that's soft to touch  
Love has gone and it hurts so much  
Well then why...  
Must the same love that made me laugh, make me cry?  
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain  
Think about it being a great big rock  
Won't you think before you started to roll it down  
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop  
I've given all I have to give  
And if you don't want me, baby  
I don't want to live  
Well then why...  
Oh, why  
Must the same love that made me laugh, gon make me cry?  
Why you wanna make me cry? [5x]  
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow  
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow  
Tell me why, oh, why, oh, why  
Why you wanna go home and make your lady cry  
You use to be so soft and sweet to me  
And now you act so wrong and mean to me  
Now you get so wrong and mean to me  
Why, oh, why, oh, why  
Oh, why you wanna mess my pillow  
You got me cryin' like a weeping willow  
Wanna make me cry

"I thought that I knew all there was to know  
I knew all about love  
I lived the highs and made it through the lows  
I knew all about love  
But now I must admit I'm surprised  
And feel I've only scratched the surface  
'Cause baby when I look in your eyes  
I understand my one true purpose

I thought I'd show you what love can be  
But what did I know  
Until along came you  
To teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you  
To teach me about love  
  
And as this feeling grows with every day  
You awaken my heart  
A heart so full I fear that it may break  
If we're ever apart  
And though one day you'll be own your own  
You know I always will be near you  
As near as on the day you were born  
Call on me, you know I'll hear you  
  
You were sent to me  
For one reason, I can tell you  
You're here to show me what love can be

"There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost y two friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and there's curves  
But the one we got to observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway  
  
Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that  
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks  
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill  
He always helped kids in the city and you know what  
I think he always will  
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so  
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go  
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news  
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us  
Don't children always tell the truth  
  
I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by  
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away  
  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world  
Oh there's warning signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway

"[Chorus]  
Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone  
I don't want nobody else to hold you  
That's a chance I'll take  
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait  
No, if the angels took me from this earth  
I would tell them bring me back to her  
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay  
Heaven can wait  
  
You're beautiful  
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful  
This love I have for you girl it's incredible  
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you  
The world could not go on so every night I pray  
If the Lord should come for me before I wake  
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unthinkable  
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone  
The time might come around when you'd be moving on  
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl  
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her  
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, can't be without my baby  
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy  
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh  
Oh no, can't be without my baby  
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy  
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh

"I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme  
I've acted out my love in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see (baby can't you see now)  
There's no one more important to me (baby)  
Baby can't you please see through me  
'cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding' nothin'  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody) cause my love's in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine (you are a friend of mine)  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you  
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you  
We were alone and I was singin' this song, singin' this song for you

When push comes to shove?  
When she whispers in your ear that she's in love?  
What's she like?

I've been holding on

"Once upon a time, not so long ago  
When things were much much simple  
And time would travel slow  
  
There came a righteous stranger  
With a bible in his hand  
To educate the sinner  
And liberate the land  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The sins of the fathers  
Have visited from old  
In a never ending circle  
Of people bought and sold  
So the wretched of the earth  
Would huddle from the cold  
As a ship of fools go sailing  
On an Ocean black as gold  
  
So come and sit beside me  
And let my tale unfold  
In a land on milk and honey  
Where the truth must not be told  
As men of right and reason  
Let the devil take their soul  
For greed and fame and fortune  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all the non believers  
Where hiding from the light  
As a thousand burning crosses  
Were scattered in the night  
The thieves and the vagabonds

As a righteous lord and master  
Stretches out a helping hand

The sick the young the old  
Where sacrifice to fortune  
And left out in the cold  
So with this new arrangement  
The leaders sold their souls  
For bangles, beads and baubles  
And a river black as gold

Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon

Away, away, away

Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring  
Came from the woodwork and the hopes they might  
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big  
  
But neon tiger there's a lot on your mind  
Strategize to maim you, but don't you let them tame you  
You're far too pure and bold  
To suffer the strain of the pain that's old.

I don't wanna be broke, I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be S.O.L.  
Give me rolling hills so tonight can be the night that I send them up a
thousand thrills  
Can you cut me some slack, Cause I don't wanna go back, I want the new day and
age  
  
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!  
  
Run neon tiger there's a price on your head  
They'll put you down and cut you, I'll never let them touch you

I was a cowboy with a throat full of sand  
I called her Honey when she brought my whiskey  
And later I left there holding her hand  
Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling

But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night

"Dear Mama, well here's a letter from your girl  
Well I think my city days are done gone  
And it ain't been three weeks since I came  
And Mama, do remember what you said  
Say your prayers before you go to bed child  
And remember city boys ain't the same  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I wish I was home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the sweet country boys don't complain  
And mama, so much perfume  
I thought I drank  
And the lord didn't seem to be nowhere around  
Hey, I felt just like a flower from the vine  
  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still  
How I'd like to be home mom  
Where the blue grass is growin'  
  
And the light shimmers and it shines  
On like a John Deere Tractor  
In a half acre field  
Tryin' to plow a furrow  
Where the soil is mighty still

"They call me love

With my little goldfish  
And eminem, em on my headphones  
You heard that yet? You will!

Becomes the seed to have anything

And the brain cells start to fry

Turns to anything will do things

Form all the things I tried

Now I'm only

Said they're happy but  
They won't be back  
I hope they have a heart attack  
'cause of what they done to me  
  
They left me for a wine bar  
They left me for the wrong car  
I dunno how I got this far

Eminem ain't so far away from this  
  
Mummy got a boyfriend  
Daddy got a girlfriend  
Gotta go away at weekends

Take every pill that I see  
You can do what you want to me

From the evil that you do

"It's like looking in the window of a fine boutique  
Knowing there is nothing that I could ever buy  
Still I want your love so much that I could die  
But I just can't lead a double life  
Being one man's lover, one man's wife  
  
But you can start a fire raging  
Just by touching me  
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch, no  
Oh, I never wanted anyone so much  
How I wish that I had found you first  
Don't you see my heart's about to burst?  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So don't keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me  
  
Let me lock the door  
Open up all my love to you  
All the love I've longed to give you since we met  
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get  
And I just can't let it disappear  
Sweet baby, please come over here  
  
Let me love you once before you go  
Your eyes keep saying yes to me  
So don't keep saying no  
Let me love you once and you will see  
No-one's ever gonna love you more than me

"He was sitting on a bar stool  
A picture from a cheating song  
She'd been standing by the jukebox  
Dropping quarters all night long.  
  
He said, tell me: are you lonely?  
Is there some place we can go?  
She said: cowboy, you know I'm lonely  
But there's something you should know:  
  
If you wanna find gold  
Go looking in the mountains  
If you wanna find silver  
Go digging in stones  
If you wanna find heaven  
Go reading in the Bible  
If you wanna find love  
Go looking at home.  
  
She touched the gold ring on his finger  
And held it to the jukebox light  
And she said. Stranger, think what you're losing  
If you leave here with me tonight.  
  
So he hold her body closer  
She felt feelings she'd never known  
And he said: thank you, for the lesson  
And if you need me I'll be at home.  
  
If you wanna find gold?

"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day  
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost herd in the sky  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel  
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat  
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet  
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry  
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o  
Ghost riders in the sky  
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name  
""If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range""  
""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""  
""A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies.""

"There's a cowboy that I know ridin' in the rodeo  
He's a feller that I'm fondest of  
I love him and he loves me and that's the way it ought to be  
But he drives me crazy when we're makin' love cause he always starts to yodel
(yodel)  
Well he always squeezed me at night while the moon was shinin' bright  
And I knew I was under his spell  
He was gazin' in my eyes and I was breathing pretty sighs  
Then like Tarzan he'd let out a great big yell And he started into yodel
(yodel)  
Well when he led me down the isle I wore such a pretty smile  
And my handsome cowboy wore a buckskin suit  
When the parson said will you promise always to be true  
My lover smiled and gently cleared his throat and he started to yodel (yodel)

"You're sort of famous  
A minor celebrity  
And so it only makes sense  
The world would be  
Obsessed with every  
Single thing you do  
  
They're running 'round  
With their camcorders in the night  
They're lurking patiently  
And hoping that they just might  
See something real embarrassing  
You do  
  
The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirts  
That's the story that  
They are gonna feature  
With exclusive pics  
Of your flabby behind  
You think you're all alone  
But that's right when you'll find  
  
A bunch of paparazzi  
Popping out of nowhere  
Cameras in your face  
And then suddenly  
You're on TMZ  
You're on TMZ  
  
Following you  
When you're walking down the street  
And asking stupid questions  
While you're trying to eat  
So you cover your face  
Thinking to yourself  
""Hey, isn't this creepy?""  
  
And they're out there praying  
You'll have a big meltdown  
And take them on a little car chase  
Through this whole town  
They'll be there with you  
When you're going to jail  
First on the scene  
For every wardrobe fail  
  
You just picked up some transvestite  
Seconds later  
It's up on the website  
Get a Vegas wedding  
A quickie divorce  
And they'll be  
Sneaking in  
Snapping pictures, of course  
  
And if they ever catch you  
Picking your nose  
Or storming down the street  
On a drunken spree  
You're on TMZ  
  
Stalking you  
Just waiting by a front door  
Trailing you through  
Airport security  
They were TMZ  
They were TMZ  
  
We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop  
Is that a baby bump?  
I pronounce you guilty, of leaving the house while fat  
Look who's drinking coffee  
Everything celebrities do is fascinating  
  
Oh, let me tell you  
It's getting to the point  
Where a famous person can't  
Even get a D.U.I  
Or go on a racist rant  
Those guys are all around  
So you really shouldn't dare  
Go to every club in town  
If you've lost your underwear  
  
Seems that every single time  
A star decides to shave their head  
Or ram their car into a tree  
They're on TMZ  
  
If they catch you peeing in the bushes  
Later on, that night  
Well, I guarantee  
You're on TMZ  
You're on TMZ  
  
You're on TMZ

Knows they're gonna be

Up to the land of the midnight sun  
Where the whale and the polar bear run  
O'er the icy blue sea

Up to the north and the pioneer life  
Where courage and strength still survive  
And a man can be free

Ever sing through the mist of your dreams  
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again  
When it's gone do you know what it means  
  
Can you picture the time when a man had to find  
His own way through the cold  
To come back again to all that you've been  
Can't you see that it's time to come home  
  
To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees  
And the earth who's the mother of all  
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade  
Will we rise with the vision or fall

"The light came through the window,  
Straight from the sun above,  
And so inside my little room  
There plunged the rays of Love.  
  
In streams of light I clearly saw  
The dust you seldom see,  
Out of which the Nameless makes  
A Name for one like me.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone.  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance,  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone.  
  
Then I came back from where I'd been.  
My room, it looked the same  
But there was nothing left between  
The Nameless and the Name.  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance,  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love itself,  
Love Itself was gone.

On the trains and dolls and cars  
Hurryin' 'cause Santa's a-waitin'  
Soldiers marchin' out the door  
Carryin' the toys galore  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
This is more than just another reindeer ride  
Not a practice run in July  
We've got to load up all the festive gear  
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose  
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow  
We'd love to sing our little working songs,  
Wish that we could tag along  
Just to see the children's faces  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh.  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys

"Looking out the window of this hollywood hotel,  
You'd never know that it was christmas eve.  
The billboards and the neon took the place of silver bells,  
And the temperature is 84 degrees.  
I can hear the traffic on the crowded strip below  
As the palm trees poke their heads above the scene  
There's not a single reindeer and it hardly ever snows,  
And santa drives a rolls royce limosine.  
  
But all along the rockies you can feel it in the air  
From telluride to boulder down below  
The closest thing to heaven on this planet anywhere  
Is a quiet christmas morning in the colorado snow  
  
I remember christmases when I was just a boy  
In the morning I would run to see the tree.  
And the carolers on the hillside sang their songs of christmas joy  
Well, I always thought they sang them just for me.  
Now the sun is setting in the california sky  
And I can't find the spirit anywhere  
So I think it's time for me to tell los angeles goodbye  
I'm going back home toook for christmas there

"They say you've found somebody new,  
But that won't stop my loving you.  
I just can't let you walk away,  
Forget the love I had for you.  
  
Guess I could find somebody, too,  
But I don't want no one but you.  
How could you leave without regret?  
Am I that easy to forget?  
  
Before you leave be sure you find  
You want his love much more than mine.  
'Cause I'll just say we've never met,  
If I'm that easy to forget.

"If everything would just stop  
Then maybe I could clear up my thoughts  
If everything would stand still  
I could've hidden how lost I feel  
  
I should've said what I hear  
I should've let myself fear  
I should've made myself clear  
  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when we find we lost our minds  
We fake what we don't know  
  
I never asked to let go  
I never thought I could sink so low  
I never let myself down  
Until the second I did right now  
  
I should've said what I hear  
I should've let myself fear  
I should've made myself clear  
  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when we find we lost our minds  
We fake what we don't know  
  
So this is how we fall apart  
This is how the ending starts  
And when our heads betray our hearts  
We fake what we don't know  
  
Cause all we are is everything we've done  
All we are is how quickly we run  
And all we are  
We are  
  
This is how we fall apart  
But this is how beginnings start  
Cause when our heads betray our hearts  
We fake what we don't know  
  
And if our doubt begins again  
The answers find us in the end  
So in the meantime we'll pretend  
And fake what we don't know  
  
This is how we fall apart

Cause when our heads betray our hearts

"Well I've been out walking  
I don't do that much talking these days  
These days,  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things that I forgot to do  
For you  
And all the times I had the chance to  
  
And I had a lover  
It's so hard to risk another these days  
These days,  
Now if I seem to be afraid  
To live the life I have made in song  
Well it's just that I've been losing for so long  
  
I'll keep on moving  
Things are bound to be improving these days  
One of these days,  
These days I sit on corner stones  
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend  
Don't confront me with my failures  
I had not forgotten them

"You know me, just look in my eyes

It's every dream you've broken  
It's only when you keep your eyes wide open

and I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
I feel you, you're under my skin  
You look in the mirror, you know where I've been  
My heart still beats but it's not the same  
Don't you know my name

Just smile along

When we were close  
I'll remember these things the most  
I see all my dreams come tumbling down  
I can't be happy without you around  
  
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay  
And there is only one thing that I can say  
  
Did you stand by me  
No, not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me  
  
Did you stand by me  
No, not at all  
  
Now I got a job  
But it don't pay  
I need new clothes  
I need somewhere to stay  
But without all these things I can do  
But without your love I won't make it through  
  
But you don't understand my point of view  
I suppose there's nothing I can do  
  
Did you stand by me  
No, not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
Did you stand by me  
No, not at all  
Did you stand by me  
No way  
  
You must explain why this must be  
Did you lie when you spoke to me?  
  
Did you stand by me

Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play  
That's the price of the high life you're livin' and you still got the devil to
pay

You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom  
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way

"Would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a mule  
  
A mule is an animal with long funny ears  
Kicks up at anything he hears  
His back is brawny but his brain is weak  
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak  
And by the way, if you hate to go to school  
You may grow up to be a mule  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a pig  
  
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face  
His shoes are a terrible disgrace  
He has no manners when he eats his food  
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude  
But if you don't care a feather or a fig  
You may grow up to be a pig  
  
Or would you like to swing on a star  
Carry moonbeams home in a jar  
And be better off than you are  
Or would you rather be a fish  
  
A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook  
He can't write his name or read a book  
To fool the people is his only thought  
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught  
But then if that sort of life is what you wish  
You may grow up to be a fish  
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish  
  
And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo  
Every day you meet quite a few  
So you see it's all up to you  
You can be better than you are  
You could be swingin' on a star

They should be arrested for murders

The essence of the truth  
The perfect moment  
That golden moment  
I know you feel it too

It is the real thing

It's like the pattern below the skin  
You gotta reach out and pull it all in  
And you feel like you're too close

Toi see the unseen glitter of life  
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife  
Cherish the certainty of now  
It kills you a bit at a time  
cradle the inspiration  
It will leave you writhing on the floor...

This nourishment, life is bent  
Into a shape I can hold  
A twist of fate, all my own

Take a step away and look around  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
The whisper is but a shout  
That's what it is all about  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the sacred song that someone sings through you  
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into  
Like the dream one day you know will come to life  
Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger  
It's the jewel of victory  
The chasm of misery  
And once you have bitten the core  
You will always know the flavor  
The split second of divinity  
You drink up the sky  
All of heaven is in your arms  
You know the reason why  
It's right there, all by itself  
And what you are, there is nothing else  
You're growing a life within a life  
The lips of wonder kiss you inside  
And when it's over the feeling remains  
It all comes down to this  
The smoke clears, I see what it is  
That made me feel this way  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood  
Pump through your veins, can't explain  
The element that's everything  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after  
Like the first time love urged you to take guidance, in silence  
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying  
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending

Can't get enough of all this stuff  
But everything is quite the same  
And all the cigarettes and pills  
All the visions, all the thrills  
They seem to come second hand  
I wonder if you understand  
The mirror is a brilliant place  
To lose myself within a maze  
They moved the moon when I looked down  
And then they turned the stars around  
I try to speak but what's the use  
Instead I scream, I'm so confused  
And when I tried to touch your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(you disappeared without a trace)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of u  
Just when I tried to touch your face  
Just come on here  
What do you think that i can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time I'll be true  
  
These days are fast, they seem like glass  
They rushing in and then they pass  
They have no value anymore  
They seem like clones or metaphors  
And honesty is what we hate  
It's what we're trying to escape from  
I wash my hands a million times  
Like Pilate when he did his crimes  
When we are young we're wild and free  
When we get old we're history  
I struggled hard to fit the mold  
I hope I die before you're old  
It doesn't matter what we gain  
When all our does or dies are in vain  
And when the music fades away  
Our memories just go astray  
Just see me through  
And please believe me what I'm telling you  
(and when the music fades away)  
Don't bring me down  
I'm standing naked here in front of you  
(your memories just go astray)  
Just come on here  
What do you think that I can do for you  
I might have lied so many times before  
But this time I'll be true...

"Here comes yet another day, creeping through my window.  
Drank myself to sleep last night, beer stains on my pillow.  
I gotta pull my things together,  
The night can last forever.  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.  
Can't even comb my hair or even change my underwear,  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
  
There goes another night, here comes another flight,  
Can't stop gotta go, here comes yet another show.  
Gotta pack up my clothes, brush my teeth, blow my nose.  
  
No time to use the john, gotta keep a rollin' on.  
Here comes a new day, here comes a new stage,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
  
Made a lot of conversation, talked a lot of weather,  
I hope we meet again some day, and spend some time together.  
No time for affection,  
I'm moving in a new direction.  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.  
Can't stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear.  
See that morning break, oh lord, here comes yet another day,  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day

"Father looks down to his son  
Says ""I was like you when I was young""  
Son looks up to father's plans  
Works in the factory with his hands  
  
Says ""I want to be just like you,  
Organize the work for the collective few""  
But as he grows up he sees no change  
Systems won't let you rearrange!  
  
Some day people will say  
""Do we have to live this way?""  
""Is this how we have to exist?""  
And the people will rise up, and resist!  
  
A majority class dominates  
A world that the lower class creates  
Media confusion hides the fact  
That we work with the rich man's knife in our back  
We're killing ourselves for a profit gain  
A profit off life what a fucking shame  
We burn that flag for the values sworn  
Some day we'll burn it to keep warm  
  
What we have done will not be lost  
To all eternity  
Everything ripens at its time  
And becomes fruit eventually!

Made by the Nero, look like a zero,  
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,  
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,  
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,  
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one  
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,  
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,  
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,

World class, first ballot hall-of-famer,

Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,  
I'm loved by your grand mama, and your baby

Now I am a winner, in a convincing sinner,

No Eazy, NWA, no 'Friday',

Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,  
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,  
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,

What you say Blood, I was a slad cause,

I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,  
See the whole industry had to bite my style,

It's sweetness both princes and peasants may calim,  
Like a bird on the wing or a bee in the clover,  
No matter the language the song is the same.  
  
Go to sleep, my baby, go to sleep,  
While the stars above begin to peep,  
They're lighting the windows of heaven, angels watch over you.  
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.

Bound to the load  
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.  
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up,

But I just can't see it  
  
Maybe I am wrong to doubt it  
And now that I think about it  
If ever I lost her love  
I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I couldn't imagine life without her love  
I just couldn't take it  
If you wanted to know how well I would get on  
I don't think I'd make it  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it  
  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl  
After all that we've been through  
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine  
(Lose that girl of mine)  
  
I'm gonna make a new start  
And bring her back to my heart  
'Cause what I found out about her  
I just cannot live without her  
  
Maybe I just don't show her  
And now that I think it's over  
I maybe should shout about it  
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing without it

"The grey mist ushers in the day.  
A beggar walks along the king's highway.  
Where does he come from? who can tell?  
They can't escape the gaze they know so well.  
The dream came true in far off lands.  
He always knew she'd understand.  
The march of time her love did wane.  
Another's crime played on the lady's pain,  
And now the ring shines in her hand.  
Who's the stranger with her wedding band?  
With faith so true, robbed of his lands  
He always knew she'd understand.

"And now we are one  
Let my soul rest in peace  
At last it is done  
My soul has been released  
For thousands of years  
My soul has roamed the earth  
In search for you  
So that someday I could give birth  
  
To know joy, joy, joy, joy  
Joy and peace is mine  
Peace divine  
And now we give thanks  
Give thanks for each other  
At peace forever  
For it is done  
  
At peace forever  
For we are one

That you would love for me to say  
All of things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that you would love to hear

Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard for me to say why  
Kinda sad, kinda blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you were in my heart  
Though we were far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say, but  
It's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start

What have I done to rate this penalty  
You suck me dry

Ascends on you

Just let me close my eyes and slip away  
Dream a dream alone  
You give me just enough rope for the task  
Let this man alone

So well rehearsed our moves once so graceful turn against us  
We stalk dark passages, we're looking for that sweet surrender

Because of Christmas day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bare her child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little Boy Child was born  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day

"They say everything can be replaced  
That every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
They say every woman needs protection  
Then they turn around and tell you  
Every woman's got to fall  
I swear, I see my own reflection  
Somewhere far beyond this wall  
I see my life come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any day now  
I shall be released  
Now, yonder stands there in that lonely crowd  
A man who swears he is not to blame, no, no  
And if you ask him has he ever seen this lonely woman?  
He'll tell you, ""No, no, no""  
What's more, he does not know my name  
But I see my light come shining  
Shining, shining, shining from the west  
Straight on down to the east  
Ah, any day now, any, any old day now  
I am going to, I am going to be released, yeah  
They tell ya, they tell ya every woman  
They tell ya every woman got to have protection  
Then they turn around and tell ya  
""No, we gonna make that a woman fall""  
Oh, god, I swear, I swear I see  
I see my, my very own reflection  
Far and away beyond, way, way beyond these four walls  
That's right, I see, I see my life, my life  
My life is shining, shining, shining  
Shining, shining, shining, shining  
From the west straight on down to the east  
And any day now, do you hear me?  
Any day now, I shall be, I am going to be released  
Any day now, any day now, any day now  
Any, any day now, oh, any day now  
Any day, any day, any day  
Any day, any day, any day  
Woah, any day, any day, any old day now  
Yeah, any day now, I am going to, I shall be released  
Woah, any day now, I shall see again  
Any day now, I shall be free again

"I stand out breaking in the Portland rain  
I see the end there in your eyes as I watch you drive away  
I walk back blind into my cold dreamhouse  
And I think about the damage  
I put the big light out  
I sit down smoking on my basement floor  
I hear footsteps up above me  
They are right outside my front door  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you move up on top of me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as you whisper in my ear  
Baby, you know I love it when you call me baby  
I go upstairs and find my twelve-year-old  
She's got tears running down her face  
Sitting sad at my piano  
She sings soft words from that old Beatles song  
And I think about my yesterday and all the things I did wrong  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you sweet dream in bed right next to me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I pull you near  
Don't give up on me  
Baby, can't you you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me  
I wish I could make you see  
That I am changing everyday, trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way it's supposed to be  
Don't give up on me  
I stand out in the rain where I watched you drive away  
I never thought I would live to see  
This fucked-up day  
I stand out in the rain in the middle of the night  
I wish that it could wash away the beast inside  
The only thing I want to do is kiss you when I am coming deep inside of you  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I hold you  
Don't give up on me  
Oh baby, can't you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me  
I wish I could make you see that I am changing everyday  
Trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way it's supposed to be

I had a heart of steel  
I always call the shots  
But, honey, you shoot to kill  
I've spent a hundred other nights like this  
A little laughter and a stranger's kiss

I was heart over head

It's too late to stop it now  
I'm heart over head

A night like this before

And still I begged for more

Well, forgive me, please

And I'm on my knees

The higher I fly

"I remember holdin' on to you,  
All them long and lonely nights I put you through.  
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry,  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico  
One place I may never go in my life again.  
Was I just off somewhere or just too high?  
But I can't remember if we said goodbye.  
  
I only miss you every now and then,  
Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean.  
Most Novembers I break down and cry,  
Cause I can't remember if we said goodbye.

"Hey little boy, whatcha got there?  
Kind sir it's a mollusk i've found  
Did you find it in the sandy ground?  
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?  
Yes I found it on the ground  
Emulating the ocean's sound  
Bring forth the mollusk cast unto me  
Let's be forever let forever be free  
  
Hey little boy come walk with me  
And bring your new found mollusk along  
Does it speaketh of the trinity  
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye  
Yes it speaks of the trinity  
Casting light at the sun with its wandering eye  
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me  
Let's be forever let forever be free  
  
You see there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand  
The waking of all creatures that live on the land  
And with just one faint glance, back into the sea  
The mollusk lingers, with it's wandering eye

"She left her neighborhood  
In which everyone was filthy rich  
She left her parent's home  
And strained with a vagabond  
Who made piles of love she never heard  
And she believed his every word  
  
She left no forwarding address  
Just took her youth and happiness  
As with the boy she vanished in  
The secret sweetness of their sin  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Lying there by the road  
  
He told her, ""love demanded space""  
So they roamed from place to place  
Although she realized she'd sinned  
She grew caution to the wind  
As she followed him around  
While he slowly dragged her down  
  
So overpowering was her love  
The it had made a captive of  
The young girl's heart and soul and mind  
In other words: love drove her blind  
  
Oh, young girl  
Oh, young girl of sixteen  
Child of spring-time  
Still green  
Laying there by the road  
  
Too much emotion for a girl  
She let her heart become her world  
What world that God has never rocked  
For a sunder we are taught  
Had she been wise and she'd have known  
She could feed him love alone  
  
She should of known the day would come  
When he would quit her just for crumbs  
He needed fresh young meat to love  
And left her heart and mind to starve

With your little head, down in your hand  
Oh, my God, you can't believe  
It's happening again  
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone  
And it looks like the end.  
  
And you're back out on the street.  
And you're tryin' to remember.  
How will you start it over?  
You don't know if you can.  
You don't care much for a stranger's touch,  
But you can't hold your man.

And I know what's been on your mind  
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

About the first time that you fell  
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no  
You just loved the boy too well, farewell  
So you live from day to day, and you dream  
About tomorrow, oh.  
  
And the hours go by like minutes  
And the shadows come to stay  
So you take a little something  
To make them go away  
And I could have done so many things, baby  
If I could only stop my mind from wonderin' what  
I left behind and from worrying 'bout this wasted time  
  
Ooh, another love has come and gone  
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on  
I remember what you told me  
Before you went out on your own:  
""Sometimes to keep it together,  
You got to leave it alone.""  
  
So you can get on with your search, baby,  
And I can get on with mine  
And maybe someday we will find,

I'm giving you flak for your airport  
I read books and you watch TV  
You wanna be free to relax more  
  
But when I think about the other people I could see  
Nobody else out there could ever make me happy  
I wonder how we came to be

But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
  
Sometimes I want to strangle your neck  
Or write you a check to get going  
There's only so much more I can take  
I made a mistake without knowing  
  
But when I think about the way you little heart beats  
When I am holding you and you are holding onto me  
I wonder how we came to be

But we are so happy in everything we do

Everyone can see that we ain't two peas in a pod  
But maybe that's our chemistry that takes us to the top  
  
I think it's working baby, that's the point I'm trying to make  
If I said something else to you then I would be a fake

"Born from silence, silence full of it  
A perfect concert my best friend  
So much to live for, so much to die for  
If only my heart had a home  
  
Sing what you can't say  
Forget what you can't play  
Hasten to drown into beautiful eyes  
Walk within my poetry, this dying music  
My love letter to nobody  
  
Never sigh for better world  
It's already composed, played and told  
Every thought the music I write  
Everything a wish for the night  
  
Wrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin  
Died for the beauty the one in the garden  
Created a kingdom, reached for the wisdom  
Failed in becoming a god  
  
Never sigh  
  
""If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it  
Remember only the verse, songmaker's cry, the one without tears  
For I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.  
Comforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality  
Where being wanted became a thrill I never knew  
The sweet piano writing down my life""  
  
""Teach me passion for I fear it's gone  
Show me love, hold the lorn  
So much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me  
I'm sorry  
Time will tell (this bitter farewell)  
I live no more to shame nor me nor you  
  
And you, I wish I didn't feel for you anymore""

Every ounce of me must see it through

"No-one seems to take up the chase, and with the familiar faces fresh in his
mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much
time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little
speed. He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa had
taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack.  
  
I see faces and traces of home back in New York City -  
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?  
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.  
The call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor  
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain  
'Cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong,  
As the weakest link in the chain.  
  
Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the
gang.  
  
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,  
I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.  
  
You say I must be crazy, 'cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.  
But I know it's me that's hitting out and I'm, I'm not full of shit.  
I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong.  
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.  
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,  
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.  
  
Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.  
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair,  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!  
Off we go...  
  
Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,  
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.  
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,  
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.  
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,  
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured  
Sheets).  
Who needs illusion of love and affection  
When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?  
Connection.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair.  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!

"People are in confusion  
The world is full of fear  
I see conflict all around us  
Can anybody out there hear  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
I see the poor and hungry  
I see the pain they bear  
Where is the hope they long for  
Does anybody out there care  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
We all must find one reason  
We all must find one cause  
For everyone to come together  
And give this world a voice  
Can't you hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
You know we got to

"Four Seasons, seconds, flicker, and flash, I'm alone.  
A lonely scream provides the scene - it's no hope.  
Every night I hear you scream, but you don't say what you mean.  
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown.  
  
I'm at the crossroads, waiting for a sign.  
My life is standing still, but I'm still alive.  
Every night I think I know,  
In the morning where did it go?  
The answers disappear when I open my eyes.  
  
I'm a stranger to this place, where real life and dreams collide.  
And even though I fall from grace, I will keep the dream alive.  
I will keep the dream alive.

"Seems the time is near for finding a place outside  
Seems the time is here for holding the window wide  
So I'm going to try  
To open up one eye  
But if the world is too wide  
I'll be home to hide  
Keep it warm inside, if it's strange, outside.  
  
Seems the time has flown, when we lived inside a cloud  
Seems the time has gone, when nothing we said was out loud  
Going to find a word  
Make myself be heard  
But if the world is too loud  
I'll be home from the crowd  
Keep it soft inside, if it's strange, outside.  
  
Seems the time has come for banging our feet to the ground  
Seems the time has come to see if the world is round  
Sweep the smoke away  
Reach the earth today  
But if the world is all wrong  
I won't be staying long  
Keep it cool inside, if it's strange, outside.

"A limousine in the night  
Drives away out of sight.  
The girl inside has stolen my pride,  
Run away with my whole life.  
  
Don't expect she'll turn around,  
Think about what she left behind.  
It's time to know what's goin' on.  
She turned my world around.  
  
She's the one, she's the girl  
That left me in this misery,  
Stole my pride, stole my life,  
Leaving me in mystery.  
  
You're my independent girl,  
You try to rule my world.  
And everytime she goes,  
She'll cast me in her spell.  
Independent girl living in her world,  
You never know how well -  
My love for her is blind.  
  
You're my independent girl,  
You try to rule my world -  
An independent girl.  
  
Day and night she feels no shame.  
Love to her is just a game.  
'Cause of her I feel I changed,  
Feel the day of her return.  
  
Calls my name, plays the game,  
Way ahead of time.  
Stole my pride, kills my life,  
Leaving me in disbelief

"Always Be A Child  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
I was there  
When you drew the breath of life  
And I could hear your voice  
The first time that you cried  
And though you couldn't see Me  
I was very near  
And there's something now  
That I want you to hear  
Chorus:  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
And when you need some love  
My arms are open wide  
And even when you're growing old  
I hope you realize  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
I was there the first time  
That you prayed  
And I heard  
All the promises you made  
And when you fell before Me  
Crying, Father, I have sinned  
I picked you up  
And held you close again

"Third-class ticket in his pocket  
Punching out the shadows underneath the sockets  
Tweed coat turned up against the fog  
Slow coaches rolling o'er the moor  
Between the very memory  
And approaches of war  
  
Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely, not the right amount  
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town  
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all he'll get
now  
Eyes going in and out of focus  
Mild and bitter from tuberculosis

If he could choose the time to die  
Then he would come and go like this  
Underneath a painted sky  
  
She woke up and called him ""Charlie"" by mistake  
And then in shame began to cry  
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase  
And then warms their hands around the brazier

Your soft plaintive whistling  
And your wan wandering smile  
Died down at The Hippodrome  
Now you're walking off to jeers, the lonely sound of jingling spurs,  
The ""toodle-oos"" and ""Oh, my dears"" down at ""The Argyle""

There's no place for a half-cut cowboy in polite society

"Down through the ages men have died for women  
And done so for many times  
Each time I loved one, I've always lost one  
Seems the right one is so hard to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color, one in each style  
I'll find a lady someday to wear them  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
I'll bet somewhere's a lady shopping for britches  
Comparing the value, appraising each pair  
Maybe someday the Lord will bring us together  
And we ll both have a new wardrobe to wear  
  
Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them  
One in each color and one in each style  
Maybe someday if I'm lucky  
I'll find someone to wear them  
And my shopping will be done for awhile  
My shopping will be done for awhile  
  
I'm looking for a lady who'll look good in dresses  
She must be red-headed, green eyes and be fair  
I'll make exceptions to all my requirements  
As long as she s willing to care  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just saw a beauty with blue eyes, what a cutie  
Bond hair like a halo around her did flow  
But the brunette beside her would be just as lovely  
In the dresses I bought long ago  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now as I sit here dreaming, planning and scheming  
Why should I make standards when everyone knows  
As your need ranges, women make changes  
And you must accept them or just let them go

"If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time  
You can't answer all the questions in your mind  
Love is love and you can't make it right  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
(Chorus)  
How can you know love when no one ever knew  
It's the mother of all happiness and father of the blues  
Love puts sunshine in your days, then steals your sleep at night  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
Maybe you should take it day by day  
If you hold love too loosely, it will fly away  
If you hold love too tightly, it will die  
It's one of the mysteries of life

When we really had it all  
You were always there to make me smile  
To help me when I fall

To have you to myself  
Then I see you standing there  
In the arms of someone else  
  
Ooh You know a girl can stand so much  
And it's more than I can fake  
  
I can't let you go  
Ooh every time I look at you  
I still can feel the glow  
Let it be, let it grow

Too young to break it

And when you walk away  
From me baby you're gonna be sorry  
I'm begging you please

"Angel came down from heaven yesterday  
Stayed with me long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday  
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea  
Then she spread her wings high over me  
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side  
  
Fly away, high away, fly away  
  
Sure enough this morning came unto me  
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise  
And my angel she said unto me  
Today's the day for you to rise  
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise  
Then she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said, Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side  
  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on my sweet angel  
Forever I will be by your side

Is that you only meant to love me  
Until you found someone new

That you had one foot out the door

Back in the beginning  
You could look me in the eye  
Do you really think  
That I am just some stupid guy  
Cause now you tell your story  
As you stare down at the floor  
Cause I don't go down Rampart Street no more  
  
I don't wanna go back there  
You won't put your hooks in me  
I'm all alone tonight  
But I'll be alright

Every time I'd come around  
You couldn't wait to sample  
What I'd brought you from downtown  
Up to your apartment

Left me pacing 'cross the floor.  
It was a dream, like those other dreams,  
So many times before.  
I went back to the old town,  
To the streets I used to roam,  
And I looked into my daddy's eyes  
And asked that fatal question, ""why'd  
You have to go? ""

And everything felt so right.

"I'm comin' Lord, for my heavenly reward  
I'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru  
Thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way  
I 'spect I'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day  
  
Lord, when I let you lead, I never make much speed  
""Cause I have to stop and touch, the ones who need so much  
Then sometimes others pull me, off of Your narrow way  
And by my mistakes, I barely make, a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land

"I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way  
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home.  
  
Mama couldn't see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers.  
  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees  
There's always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand  
  
And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.  
Oh, I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love.  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need.

"Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes,  
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies.  
  
Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead.  
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head.  
Politicians argue sharpening their knives.  
Drawing up their Bargains, trading baby lives.  
  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
  
Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way.  
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?  
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is here to stay.  
Jesus son of Mary is born again today.

Waiting for the manna coming from the west.

"Well the red light shines  
On the streets of hate  
Where the devil dines  
Who knows what he ate  
  
""It's a simple thing  
Trying to stay afloat""  
The captain said  
Without his boat  
  
Some things are getting better  
Other things a little worse  
It's a situation  
Much like a curse  
  
""It's the devil's sidewalk  
It's the devil's door  
I've tried to avoid it""  
Said the captain of the shore  
  
There's a garden growing  
And a million weeds  
With no way of knowing  
Who's done which deed  
  
""That's an honest tale""  
Said the helmsman to the mate  
""About a woman delicious  
And a matter of fate""  
  
Big wheel keep rollin'  
Down on me  
""One thing I can tell you  
Is you got to be free""  
  
John Lennon said that  
And ""I believe in love""  
But I believe in action  
When push comes to shove  
  
""Who cares what you believe,""  
Said the captain, amazed  
""If you stood in my shoes  
Your eyes would be glazed""  
  
So, my fair damsel  
Won't you take your leave  
Are you headed for the country?  
Where you wear the greensleeves  
  
And the children laugh  
And the old folks sing  
And the church bell tolls  
For a miraculous thing  
  
Where the big red furnace  
Just blooms and glows  
Where the big heart beats  
Where the big wheel rolls

Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast  
Just when I think that they are gonna stay  
Everything inside me just starts fading away  
  
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  
Just gets thrown down on the floor  
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore  
Sometimes I wish that I could run away  
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say  
  
He looks at me and doesn't know the words to say  
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today  
All these things I say and do were never planned  
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that

"This big town is a shelter for me  
I found a place to hide my misery  
I lost my love so long ago  
And though my heart is hurting so  
The one I love will never know  
As long as I stay  
  
In this big town I find the peace of mind  
That only losers in the game of love can find  
The years have gone crawling by  
This hurt I feel will never die  
Somehow I know deep down inside  
I'll never get away from this big town  
From this big town  
  
In this big town there's a street of misery  
And on the street there's a dwelling place for me  
In the darkness of my room I try  
To sleep but all I do is cry  
And still I realize that  
I am ever lucky to be here  
  
In this big town so no one else can see  
Just what your cheating heart has done to me  
The glimmer of the city lights  
The shadows of the lonely nights  
Will help to hide me while I cry  
A hundred dreaded tears

They're sick of the decisions, now my family is good  
Make you well understood, put you back where you should be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This go for all my people, people who see we're equal  
I feel they come, it is dark, I protect us from evil  
We misheard an illusion, car can make a confusion  
People constantly losing, we suffer everywhere  
Enough with all this swagger, party's a baggy bagger  
We hear a session is starting, let me show you what's heading at  
Money's so fucking tight, the root to all them fights  
She make you wanna not ever, not ever come home at night  
But she know that you go off with that stripping ho  
While your woman is wondering where does all your money go  
You try to make it rain, maybe lock you a chain  
Maybe inducing brain from bitches everywhere  
Pussy nigga, you lame, get on top of your game  
Feed your family, man, this is simple and plain  
Children retain, remember living upon the pain  
That's when they curse your name, they will see you do the same  
Yeah, so spread it out, nigga

I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it's everybody's sin

Is books, written pages  
Live and learn from fools and  
From sages  
You know it's true, oh

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, just for today  
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

You know how dangerous that can be

For my fighter pilot to be free  
To dive bomb on the population

"Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  
Right now the only thing that my mind ever holds,  
Are long dark silences or screaming that explodes,  
Burning rocking beds with visions of a land,  
Long dark tunnels, questions and calm,  
But, with you, you know I have no doubts,  
And fear will have no sting,  
With your brilliant eyes and your lost and broken wing,  
My head upon your shoulder as you take me in your arms,  
Continents will crumble, we will find no harm.  
Chorus  
With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,  
But, there's madness in the sycamore trees,  
And there's no salvation to be found.  
Well I'll brace myself against the dark, endeavour to go on,  
No matter how long it takes, and even though I might be wrong,  
And I will ask a little favour of whatever God I find,  
And I will come back for you darling, when I find some peace of mind.  
Well I don't know about tomorrow, it will be here and gone,  
I don't know about tonight, it'll be too long,  
Sometimes I think I'm dying, and I don't care how,  
All I know is that I want you, and I want you here and now.

With your dark hair in the donegal breeze,  
Bringing me softly and sweetly to the ground,

The night about to end  
I pass my time with strangers  
But this bottle's my only friend

On Butler Street out in the dark  
Remember when we lost the keys  
And you lost more than that in my backseat  
  
Remember how we used to talk  
About busting out, we'd break their hearts

Hoping it would never end

Racing cars and being cool  
With a six pack and the radio  
We didn't need no place to go  
  
Remember at the prom that night  
You and me we had a fight  
But the band they played our favorite song  
And I held you in my arms so strong  
  
We danced so close  
We danced so slow  
And I swore I'd never let you go  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye

"All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning  
And the future's on the bound,  
Hell don't know my fury  
You're all I need, you're all I need  
You're all I need-and maybe some faith would  
Do me good  
  
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I  
Change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many  
Variations to consider  
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me  
More to do,  
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,

"  
Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky  
  
We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know  
They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.  
Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away  
off into the big blue sky  
We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get  
We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.  
To dumb to worry or wonder why  
we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.  
  
Chorus  
I guess we were just  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our
heads  
We've been knocke down, sucked in  
spun round, shaken up, thrown away  
and left for dead  
but somehow we always made it out alive  
on the other side of the Big Blue Sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a  
Big Blue Sky  
  
It's nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Baby lookin back  
everthing they said  
Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,  
It's a great big lie  
ain't nothin over head  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through

The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me  
When other helpers fail and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me  
  
Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes  
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies  
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee

Has been spoken by the Jester  
Standing against the tide  
Is the noblest of gestures  
It's the little pearls of wisdom

That makes us laugh until we cry  
Because we know that they are right

And the Life of my Times  
In the Company of Fools  
I'm wading through the quicksand  
In the gardens of the gentry  
Blooming vacuity  
Leaves mind and pockets empty  
In the Social Order  
I accept the bottom rung  
Until the wine is pouring  
And the Lord commands a song  
Meet me at the staff door  
When the posers all go home  
We'll gather with the other Fools  
And put on a proper show  
So here's to the Poorest Poet  
Who always pens the truth  
Players Writers and Gypsies  
The Minstrels and their tunes  
I'd rather live an honest lifetime  
With those with nothing to lose  
Than waste a night  
Knee deep in shite

And now it's so easy to see.  
Warm at night  
She sleeps so tight.  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile  
She was my best friend for a while.  
Well, I was no hurricane  
A daylight dream of mine.  
She comes with the sun.  
In the morning sun  
We shared the mystery of a power.  
She was an angel in my darkest hour.  
As I close my eyes  
I can see her face  
Feel inside a rhythm  
I can feel her warm embrace.  
She comes with the sun  
In the morning sun  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile.  
She was my best friend for a while.

"Intro  
Let us not feel an ounce of remorse  
When the time comes and the brains  
Behind the muscle get what they fucking deserve!  
  
News broadcasts ratings grow.  
War and scandal do you want to know.  
How many people died today.  
Dealt with pain and suffering  
  
Are you terrified  
For our lives  
It looks to be  
The end's in sight  
  
Go and fight for evil and lies  
Everything you stand for I despise  
I'd rather live than die for something  
Something that will never end  
  
Force them to fight so we can be free  
Until the end  
Money and power is the reality  
Until the end  
It's two things the world leaders thrive for  
  
Until the end  
And that's why this will never stop  
Until the end  
That's why this will never stop  
Until the end

"I've got my own moral compass to steer by  
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky  
And all the preaching voices  
Empty vessels of dreams so loud  
As they move among the crowd  
Fools and thieves are well disguised  
In the temple and marketplace  
In the temple and marketplace  
  
Like a stone in the river  
Against the floods of spring  
I will quietly resist  
I will quietly resist  
  
Like the willows in the wind  
Or the cliffs along the ocean  
I will quietly resist  
I will quietly resist

I don't have faith in faith  
I don't believe in belief  
You can call me faithless  
You can call me faithless  
I still cling to hope  
And I believe in love  
And that's faith enough for me  
And that's faith enough for me  
  
I've got my own spirit level for balance  
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down  
And all the shouting voices  
Try to throw me off my course  
Some by sermon, some by force  
Fools and thieves are dangerous  
In the temple and marketplace  
In the temple and marketplace  
  
Like a forest bows to winter  
Beneath the deep white silence  
I will quietly resist

"Saw her there in the fading light  
In full bloom on a summer night  
Nothing but the man in the moon  
Was standing in my way  
  
I was drunk on the warm sweet air  
Tangled up in her raven hair  
I should've known but I didn't care  
She'd be gone by the light of day  
  
Cause her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars fell all around her  
Well did I see you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
  
Now the sun dances across my room  
I can smell the wine and her soft perfume  
The only thing that lets me know  
That an angel wasn't here  
  
You know I had this crazy dream  
She flew away on stolen wings  
But all she took was a pair of jeans  
When see saw that the coast was clear  
  
And her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars fell all around her  
Well did I see you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
  
And her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars they fell all around her  
Well I thought I saw you smilin'

"I wish you love  
And happiness  
I guess I wish you  
All the best  
I wish you don't  
Do like I do  
And ever fall in love with  
Someone like you  
Cause if you fell  
Just like I did  
You'd probably walk around the block  
Like a little kid.  
But kids don't know  
They can only guess  
How hard it is  
To wish you happiness  
  
I guess that love  
Is like a Christmas card  
You decorate a tree  
You throw it in the yard  
It decays and dies  
And the snowmen melt  
Well I once knew love  
I knew how love felt  
Yeah I knew love  
Love knew me  
And when I walked  
Love walked with me  
And I got no hate  
And I got no pride  
Well I got so much love  
That I cannot hide  
  
Say you drive a Chevy  
Say you drive a Ford  
You say you drive around the town  
Till you just get bored  
Then you change your mind  
For something else to do  
And your heart gets bored with your mind  
And it changes you  
Well it's a doggone shame  
And it's an awful mess

I wish you happiness  
I wish you love

We knew we had to be strong.  
All this time.  
Through the tears and the laughter.  
It's still forever after all this time.  
  
In the fast movin' world.  
Love is made and just thrown away.  
But we've always kept the promises that we made.  
Who would of thought you and me?  
Would still be here where we said we would be.

She's got an angel's face and a devil's grin  
She kinda stared me down as I looked her up  
She said ""I'm your poison, now you drink a cup.""  
  
In the heat of the night is when she comes alive  
She's gonna push you push you til she's satisfied  
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips  
She whispers ""If you want to taste my love  
why don't you swallow this.""

She lives just around the corner, right down the street  
All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets

"Darling, I received your last long letter,  
And enclosed I found a petal from the rose  
That I picked and placed within your hair,  
Dear when we strolled beneath the moon-beams long ago.  
  
You say that you can understand today, dear,  
Why in tears I told you when you went away  
Now you're leaving and I'll be so lonely  
Like a faded petal from a beautiful bouquet.  
  
You tell me that tonight you're broken hearted,  
Your happiness in life sweetheart, you say, is through,  
And that you regret the day you left me  
And broken my heart to change an old love for the new.  
  
With aching heart in tears I write this letter,  
Old mem'ries I could never, never cast away.  
I forgive you and you'll find me waiting

The faithful and blind are keepin' me, keepin' me down  
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,  
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down  
  
Do you live in the light  
Or in the dead of the night?  
Sanctimonious promises broken  
Hypocritical sin,  
Dying slowly within,  
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?  
  
Life ever after,  
Bohemian rapture,  
Beware the dark side of the sun.  
You're just a self-made messiah,  
Selling brimstone and fire  
So come on, Jesus,  
Don't keep us waiting just for you  
  
How long must we keep on waiting?  
The faithful and blind are bringin' me, bringin' me down  
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,  
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down

Have you already been here once or twice?

How will I know that you're the son of God?

A broken home  
I'd like to share some air with you  
Some air with you  
A morning forest full of truths  
The green is blue  
The head that's getting pregnant lives  
To give and give  
What was I thinking in my head  
The color red  
Breaking hearts instead of bread  
Something I said  
Checkmated by frustration  
Need to be cut loose  
A different kind of being lost  
A sullen cost

In Timbuktu  
Do I need repeat

Named Sue

To the beat

And your  
Forehead

There's something left inside

"All that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,  
Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,  
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,  
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
You must believe me,  
I can feel your eyes go through me,  
But I don't know why.  
  
I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,  
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,  
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to  
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said,  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
I can feel your eyes go through me  
  
It seems I've spent too long  
Only thinking about myself  
Now I want to spend my life  
Just caring bout somebody else.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,

In a bar room  
Liquor was the only love I'd known  
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom  
Brought me back from being too far gone  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time  
I looked for love  
In all the same old places  
Found the bottom of the bottle's  
Always dry  
But when you poured out your heart  
I didn't waste it  
Cause there's nothing like your love  
To get me high  
You're as smooth as Tennesee whiskey  
You're as sweet as strawberry wine  
You're as warm as a glass of Brandy  
And I stay stoned on your love all the time

"When I was young and the world belonged to me,  
I thought that love meant pain and jealousy.  
It was a cross on my shoulder.  
Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older.  
Mmm. Mmm.  
  
Time had a way of making me see my lonely life has taken its toll on me.  
Now, I feel the emptiness and I don't wanna live like this.  
Now, I've heard stories, I've heard songs telling me believe my heart.  
Don't wait too long with words that don't ring true until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine until the end of time.  
  
How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel,  
And how deep my soul, how much can I reveal?  
I'm lost in love's mystery, caught between time and eternity.  
Now, there's a door that opens wide.  
Slowly I will find my way and I'll reach inside.  
But I couldn't make it through until there was you.  
  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I know  
That you'll be mine and only when I see  
The light of love shine until the end of time.  
Never will I lose this heart's desire.  
Ever will I feel our love's fire.  
And when I see the light of love shine in your eyes when they meet mine,  
Only then I'll know it's you and I until the end of time.

"You've made up your mind  
It was time  
It was over  
After we had come so far  
But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I would not have chosen the road you have taken  
It has left us miles apart  
Well I think I can still find a will to keep going  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
So fly  
Go ahead and fly  
Until you find out who you are  
'Cause I  
Will keep my love unspoken  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I hope that in time  
You will find what you longed for  
Love that's written in the stars  
And when you finally do  
I think you'll see it  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
So fly  
Go ahead and fly  
Until you find out who you are  
'Cause I  
Will keep my love unspoken  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I would not have chosen the road you have taken  
It has left us miles apart

"I'd like to be your friend but think of all the friends I've been  
I never thought there'd come a day I never thought I'd hear me say  
I'd disappoint you in the end no new friends please no new friends for me  
Memories of old acquaintances keep on coming back  
Some I met at garden parties buddies by the railroad track  
I'd like to be your friend  
  
What we are is self-appointed there's nothing we can do  
We'd lose touch with one another and that ain't fair to me or you

"There's a full time reservation  
Made in a bar at the railway station.  
And there's a story, a kind of fable,  
On a card at the corner table.  
On it is a message, been there some time.  
It starts off, ""The coffee tasted so fine""  
It says, ""One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. ""  
It goes on to say, ""I love you.  
If you should find this I must hear from you. ""  
It gives a number but the name has faded away.  
All that is left are just the words, ""Maybe someday""  
That's the story and the fable,  
Never leave alone from a corner table.  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo.

"The dogs are howling at the midnight moon.  
I'm on my way to where the black rose blooms.  
The mountain's high, the night is cold.  
I feel the sunshine a black rose grows.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Together again, we're as common as sin, they say,  
We just walk around the stones they throw.  
Night after night, we steal away to where  
Love don't see no colors in the shadows,  
Love don't see no colors in the shadows.  
  
Wind in the willows, wild and warm,  
Just like the woman lying here in my arms.  
The water's deep, cold and still.  
I love the feeling that black rose gives.

Underneath the door there's a hole and it goes to infinity.  
Standin' on a dark street, there's a light in the sky.  
Followin' the light through the night as it goes to infinity.  
How can I avoid infinity? How have I annoyed infinity?  
I'm movin' slow in infinity. I even glow in infinity.

It's hard being' small, (hard bein' small)  
Shrinkin' into space, (shrinkin' into space)  
The world is just a ball, (world is just a ball)  
It was my favorite place (it was my favorites place)  
  
Lookin' for the blue skies, watchin' for the sunrise.  
One thing you can bet, you won't see it set in infinity.  
Gonna take a light beam, on the wings of the Jet Stream.  
Gonna take my place in the infinite space of infinity.  
How can I be friends with infinity? Can I make ammends with infinity?  
How can I complain to infinity? What'll I explain to infinity?

Give me just a time shield before the world has it's fate sealed.  
Protect me for a while before they turn my dial to infinity.  
I hope I can contribute, oh, but I don't want a tribute.  
Hypocrites will come and say somethin' really dumb in infinity.  
I can't hear you sing in infinity. I can't change a thing in infinity.  
The absence of light in infinity gives me a fright in infinity.

"Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,  
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,  
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.  
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,  
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,  
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to  
minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.

"Jump, bounce, down, up  
  
I went out on a date,  
With a girl, a bit late,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.  
I brought my pogo stick,  
Just to show her a trick,  
She had so many friends,  
Gliding through many hands.

But just one pogo stick.

You look at me that way  
I know what your eyes say  
Your eyes reflect love and desire  
I see that you need me  
I need you to please me  
You touch me and set me on fire  
It's the way that you love me

The way that you whisper my name  
I cannot resist you  
Each time I kiss you  
Then everything goes up in flames

Hot as a pistol of flaming desire

Puts fireworks in motion  
It looks like the fourth of July  
There's no use in fighting  
The fire you've ignited  
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly

"This is the moment  
This is the day  
This is the moment  
When I know  
I am on my way  
Every endeavour  
I have made ever  
Is coming into play  
Is here and now today  
  
This is the moment  
This the time  
When the momentum  
And the moment  
are in rhyme  
Give me this moment  
My precious chance  
I'll gather up my best  
And make some sense at last  
  
This is the moment  
When all I've done  
All of the dreaming,  
scheming and screaming  
becomes one  
This is the day,  
Just see it shine  
When all that I have lived for  
Becomes mine  
  
This is the moment  
This is the hour  
When I can open up,  
tomorrow  
like a flower  
And put my hand to  
Everything I plan to  
Fulfill my grand desire  
See all my stars align  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned  
I never reckoned second best  
I won't look back  
I must not fall  
This is the moment  
The sweetest moment  
Of them all  
  
This is the moment  
So double the odds  
This day or never  
I'll sit forever  
with the gods  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all.

I knew he hated leaving  
But he had to set us up  
  
I gave him money  
I know I invested well

It's been six months, maybe better

But I love him more then ever

I've waited long enough  
If there was nothing wrong  
He would return right on that bus  
  
There must be trouble  
So I'm leavin' on the double  
If he can't get to me  
I know he needs me desperately

And as he waved goodbye  
He said don't cry

Get treated like some kind of terrorist raids.

Well I ain't gettin' too much in return.  
I'm doin' my best to love you baby,

And if I can't get inspired 'round here,  
I'm going out to the world and learn.  
There's action in my soul tonight.

I learned all about the tolls that it takes.  
I get something in my mind -- it begins to unfold  
I get out in the cold -- I can't do what I'm told  
I get out of control -- I can't hold on to the brakes  
When you're cut down to the bone.  
You bleed but it heals.  
You hurt still you must carry on.

The one who made everything, (everything) elephants and flowers (oh, yeah)  
The one who will listen when all others will not. (all others will not)

"If I passed you on the street  
Would you look the other way  
Afraid that we would meet  
Could it be that it's down to tears?  
After all the love we knew  
It was so hard losing you  
Now I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you, ooh, oh  
  
I try to put the thoughts away  
But I see your face before me  
As you turn to walk away  
And I can force a smile  
'Cause it turned out so wrong  
After feeling so right so long  
And I'm just not ready for another day alone  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside, oh  
God knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
Yeah, yeah  
I feel it coming on  
That emptiness again  
  
'Cause I've been living without your love, oh  
Just making believe I can still get by  
Paying the price inside  
Lord knows the hardest thing I'll ever do  
Losing you  
  
I'm, just living  
Oh, living without your love  
I'll get by  
But I'm paying, yeah  
Without your love  
I can't get back to much more love  
Oh no  
I'm not ready for  
I'm not ready for  
Love and loneliness  
Living, oh yes, I'm living without your love  
I'll just get by  
I'm just getting by  
I can't stand it much longer  
Ah, living, living without

"Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
  
Remember the time we swam naked  
In your father's pool?  
Boy he was upset that night  
But boy was that ever cool  
  
Remember the night we played poker for money  
And you robbed me blind  
Remember how you used to scream so loud  
Cause you hated that number nine  
  
Hey, I saw your sister skating on the lake  
This afternoon  
Good Heaven how she's grown  
She swoons the boy skaters she's so tall  
  
But of all your father's children  
All your father's children, baby  
You know, you are the finest of them all  
You are brighter than the northern star  
  
Last night I spent another lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you, you should've been there  
You see, of all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
My momma used to say  
Always trust your lover  
Now I guess that only applies to her  
  
Cause baby you promised me  
Baby you promised me you'd never leave  
Then you died on the twenty fifth day of December  
Oh baby  
  
Last night I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, baby, you, you should've been there  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for  
Yeah  
  
Your father said it was pneumonia  
Your mother said it was strep  
But the doctor said you were dead  
And I, I say its senseless  
  
Every Christmas night for seven years now  
I drink banana daquaris 'til I'm blind  
As long as I can hear you smilin' baby  
You won't hear my tears  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
Yeah, mine  
Yeah  
Another lonely Christmas is mine  
  
Last night, yeah, I spent another lonely, lonely Christmas  
Darling, darling, you should've been there, yeah  
Cause all the ones I dream about  
You are the one that makes my love shout  
You see, you are the only one I care for

"Come to the dinner gong  
The table is laden high  
Fat bellies and hungry little ones  
Tuck your napkins in  
And take your share  
Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing  
Though there's plenty to spare  
  
I took my share down by the sea  
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide  
Seagulls come down  
And they squawk at me  
Down where the water-skiers glide  
  
Some turn to Jesus  
And some turn to heroin  
Some turn to rambling round  
Looking for a clean sky  
And a drinking stream  
Some watch the paint peel off  
Some watch their kids grow up  
Some watch their stocks and bonds  
Waiting for that big deal  
American Dream  
  
I took my dream down by the sea  
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine  
And logs and sails  
And Shell Oil pails  
Dogs and tugs and summertime  
Back in the banquet line  
Angry young people crying  
  
Who let the greedy in  
And who left the needy out  
Who made this salty soup  
Tell him we're very hungry now  
For a sweeter fare  
In the cookie I read  
""Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing  
Though there's plenty to spare""

"So I'm down and so I'm out  
But so are many others  
So I feel like tryin' to hide  
My head 'neath these covers  
  
Life is like the seasons  
After winter comes the spring  
So I'll keep this smile awhile  
And see what tomorrow brings  
  
I've been told and I believe  
That life is meant for livin'  
And even when my chips are low  
There's still some left for givin'  
  
I've been many places  
Maybe not as far as you  
So I think I'll stay awhile  
And see if some dreams come true  
  
There isn't much that I have learned  
Through all my foolish years  
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles  
First there's laughter, then those tears  
  
But I'll keep my head up high  
Although I'm kinda tired  
My gal just up and left last week  
Friday I got fired  
  
You know it's almost funny  
But things can't get worse than now  
So I'll keep on tryin' to sing  
But please, just don't ask me how

You lose

Is risking a lot

And see it through  
And if it's refused  
What can you do?  
Continue hopefully?  
Start anew?

Buy your booze  
You won't get drunk by accident  
You'll choose  
Don't blame him  
For refusing your bid

"When we start a'dancing I'm a nervous wreck,  
Your kinda shaking has a rare effect.  
I can't stop a'flipping over what you're doing,  
That kinda beat can drive a man to ruin.  
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout.  
Stop! You're knockin' me out.  
  
Crazy 'bout your rhythm when you're rocknrolling,  
All I'm asking honey is that you control it.  
Your dancing is entrancing, oh, yes indeedy,  
But my one objection is you're much too speedy.  
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout.  
Stop! You're knockin' me out.  
  
We go dancing, and everything is fine,  
We're romancing, the music is divine,  
Then the band starts to syncopate,  
You jump from thirty three to seventy eight.  
  
Spinning like a record on a record machine,  
You've got me going dizzy over your routine.  
The way ya shake your shoulders and the way ya twist 'em  
Starts a chain reaction in my nervous system.  
Slow down baby, can ya hear me shout.  
Stop! You're knockin' me out.  
  
Oh now, we go dancing, everything is fine,  
We're romancing, the music is divine.

I vowed to myself I'll see you no more but here we are again

"It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long  
Caught somewhere between a boy and man  
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between  
It was summertime in Northern Michigan  
Ahh Ahh Ahh  
Ahh Ahh Ahh  
  
Splashing through the sand bar  
Talking by the campfire  
It's the simple things in life, like when and where  
We didn't have no internet  
But man I never will forget  
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair  
  
[Chorus]  
And we were trying different things  
We were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  
  
Catching Walleye from the dock  
Watching the waves roll off the rocks  
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul  
We'd blister in the sun  
We couldn't wait for night to come  
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll  
  
While we were trying different things  
And we were smoking funny things  
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  
  
Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change  
Or how we thought those days would never end  
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along  
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

"She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight  
She loves the theater, but doesn't come late  
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate  
That's why the lady is a tramp  
Doesn't like crap games, with barons and earls  
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls  
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls  
That's why the lady is a tramp

Deep into the night, they were testing him  
So many different species, harry could not win

And she would find a warm spot back in Harry's neck

Now I've got this stunning pain  
And my neck is feeling weird, oh I might die

"In the centre of the storm  
Something magic being born  
When the world is torn apart  
By the beating of a heart  
Like a dam about to burst  
Like a drunkard's crazy thirst  
In the centre of the storm  
Something magic being born  
It's the dark hours of the soul  
When the nightmares take their toll  
When the shadows come to mock  
Against the ticking of the clock  
When the demons of the night  
Come like vultures for their bite  
In the dark hours of the soul  
When the nightmares take their toll  
It's the dawning of the day  
Night-time's panic swept away  
When the clouds which seemed so dark  
Are exchanged for morning's lark  
When the stars which burnt so bright  
Are exchanged for morning light  
In the dawning of the day

To hear the words  
Of hope and consolation  
With no star to guide us through the night  
  
Through many realms of fantasy  
We wander and we roam  
Far away from home  
  
Then all of those  
We held so dear  
Grew tired of understanding  
And we dream through the endless night alone  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away, far away  
Like a leaf that the wind has blown  
Far away, far away  
Far away from home  
Far away from home

What I've become  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away, far away  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
Far away

Far away

Seen this tan mami, she was fresh off the sand dunes  
Big bottles and models and poom-pooms  
Surroundin' my table, watchin' me like cable  
My Dolce hat was low, Versace shades  
Had the Prada shoes on 'cause the world is a stage  
Lah-lah in the air, it's a sky bar affair  
The glamorous life, I had my glass in the air  
When my eyes connected with somethin' real real nice  
Like she finished her drink and started chewin' on my ice  
Her smile was bananas, teeth was pearly white  
That's when I realized it'll be a long night

My vision was blurry, the party was rockin  
The tools was knockin, honey want to get it poppin'  
Try my best to chill, she was fresh out of Brazil  
People was walkin' by makin' our drinks filled  
What would you do, if you was a Don  
In a position to wild out with a Brazilian blond?  
Or maybe you a honey and it's hard to keep calm  
Cause you sippin' on somethin' and homeboy's the bomb  
You dancin' in your seat, and singin' along  
And every sip makes you feel like you need to perform  
The party is packed, it's just a little too warm  
But you take another sip to prove that you strong

and I knew I must stay  
oh I must stay  
  
now we are free  
and we are growing old  
the wishing tree still stands there  
and shades our memories  
  
of when  
we played the part of lovers  
on that summer night  
  
we played the part of lovers  
you gave all your love and you made it seem right  
you made me a man oh so young in my life

",A Song For Suzanne,Styx
"Does she love me, with all her heart  
Should I worry, when were apart  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.  
  
Does she need me, as she pretends  
Is this a game, well then will I win  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know  
  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just how I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just how I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know.  
Oh, I'd like to know.  
  
Answer my, lover's question

",A Lover's Question,Kenny Loggins
"You know, every house has a door and every room has a floor.  
Every fence has a gate and every beast has a mate.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing.  
  
Every stove has a fire and every car has a tire.  
Every fish has a bowl and every shoe has a sole.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing.  
  
Now I don't care about politics and things across the sea.  
All I want all I want to do is love  
And have somebody love me. I need I need somebody.  
  
Every lion has a den and every little pig has its pen.  
Every road has a way and (they tell me) every dog has its day.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing. Oh no.

"A smile on my face  
A song on my lips  
Pretending is all I do  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
  
I'm gay with the crowd  
I play with the crowd  
But oh, if they only knew  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
Must I go on carrin' on?  
  
My merry song is just pretend  
Loving you so, wanting you so  
Where will it end, how will it end?

"Well just the other day  
While alone in my room  
I said to myself  
I need something new  
I've cut a new life slice  
And feed the lions twice  
And they'll shake their manes in confusion

My love's in vain

My love's in vain  
My love

My love's in vain

Maybe an older woman  
Will show me a way  
To ease those creases  
And crave no reasons  
'Cause reasons are with gods  
There's a heaven within me  
But we all shake our manes in confusion  
  
Should I grab you by the collar  
Or just go my way  
With a knife between my clean white teeth  
Don't want your feather in my cap  
Don't care about that  
You can brush your own mane  
Fame is your pain

Put on your coat and hat

Three four open the door  
Hurry for heaven's sake  
I count every step you take  
While I'm waiting for you  
Five six my eyes are fixed  
On that picture of your charm  
Seven eight you're at the gate  
And you walk into my arms  
Nine ten kiss me again

Far away, far away  
You you keep on moving  
Far away, far away

And the crime  
Still returning

You dance across the seasons,  
To a place where no one knows  
Where angels fear to tread

"When we meet again  
Just refer to me as ""back then""  
Or pretend not to recall  
Ever knowing me at all  
Or hanging round my door  
Begging for more  
  
When you begin  
Playing to win  
That's when the losers rush in  
  
And I...  
I got better than you  
At jumping the queue  
To get closer to seeing  
Who's who...  
  
A man without a home  
Is never alone  
Well just look at what he's got  
The whole parking lot  
In those unsheltered places  
There's always other places  
  
Take mine for a start  
It's like a modern work of art  
Disturbing and lacking in heart  
  
And I...  
I got better than you  
At jumping the queue  
To get closer to seeing  
Who's who...  
  
It must be so wonderful  
Being you every day  
Oh, it must be so wonderful  
Always gettin' your way  
  
A common dialogue  
Is the best thing that you'll get  
From the woman you call wife  
So try not to forget  
To tear out and burn  
The things you unlearn  
  
Your future exists  
In her shopping list  
Please  
Call your office  
  
And I...  
I got better than you  
At jumping the queue  
To get closer to seeing  
Who's who...  
  
I got better than you

"Oh well, I love you pretty baby  
You're the only love I've ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well, I'm moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
And I would give everything I own

But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away

Everything I own  
  
You know, baby  
My love for you will always be true

Because there is no me without you

"I packed it all on a whim  
Threw an old Hank cassette tape in  
Dad's '84 rusty Ford  
He swore we'd never make it  
I quit my job, let my momma down  
Broke an angel's heart on the way out  
Of town  
Pulled my roots from the ground for  
The hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have that's worth losin'  
Damn country music  
You might get lost in the lights  
The things that keep you up all night  
Whiskey straight 3 a.m.  
Chasin' songs in your head  
It's the sweetest highs, the lowest lows  
Needin' yes and hearin' no  
Just another so-so  
Believe me i know  
It's the hum of wheels on the blacktop  
The strum of strings on a flat top  
It'll take you, break you  
Damn sure make you  
Do things you never thought you'd be doing  
Damn country music  
When the money, the fame  
The lights on your name  
All fade away  
Well you'll still be a slave to

It's a neon fever for a small town dreamer  
Tells you everything you have that's worth losing

"I will wander 'til the end of time, torn away from you  
  
I pull away to face the pain  
I close my eyes and drift away  
Over the fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Torn away from you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us from sorrow's hold  
Or from my hard heart  
  
I can't go on living this way  
And I can't go back the way I came  
Shamed of this fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Half a life without you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us, change, open your eyes to the light  
I denied it all so long, oh so long  
Say goodbye, goodbye  
  
My heart is broken  
Release me, I can't hold on  
Deliver us, my heart is broken

"Please tell me what is taking place,  
'Cause I can't seem to find a trace,  
Guess it must have got erased somehow,  
Probably cause I always forget,  
  
Every time someone tells me their name,  
It's always gotta be the same.  
(In my World)  
Never wore cover-up,  
  
Always beat the boys up,  
Grew up in a 5000 population town,  
Made my money by cutting grass,  
Got fired by fried chicken ass,  
All in a small town, Napanee.  
  
You know I always stay up without sleepin',  
And think to myself,  
Where do I belong forever,  
In whose arms, the time and place?  
  
[Chorus]  
Can't help if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way,  
I may switch off and go in a daydream,  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
But sometimes I can't even speak,  
Would someone be and not pretend? I'm off again in my World  
  
I never spend less than an hour,  
Washin' my hair in the shower,  
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,  
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,  
Though it may take all friggen day,  
There's nothin' else better to do anyway.  
  
When you're all alone in the lands of forever,  
Lay under the milky way,  
On and on it's getting too late out,  
I'm not in love this time this night.

Mellow out,  
Party up,  
But don't fall down,  
Don't get caught,  
Sneak out of the house.

My eyes tune out the other way,

"It snowed the night before and it had frozen on the ground  
We didn't have a car and we lived seven miles from town  
And I can hear my daddy's voice, so many years ago  
Saying  
""Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday, tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe""  
Me and Quentin went back on the hill and we cut some wood  
Burnin' in that ol' warm mornin' stove it sure smelled good  
Daddy couldn't get work then and I was just a child  
And God was on vacation for awhile  
""Well, if you see Fred you tell him I'll come help him kill them hogs  
And ask him if he'd still be interested in my dogs  
Don't hang around that pool room all day, we might get more snow  
And don't forget the coffee Billy Joe""  
Well, they wonder why there ain't no rabbits left this day and time  
To tell the truth I guess we ate 'em all in '49  
Was that yesterday or was it over 20 years ago  
""Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe""  
""Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off

Is not unlike my own  
Island they say no man is like you  
They say you stand alone

And I tried to sail in but your wind and waters  
Tore my sails and broke my oars.

Silhouettes of ships in the night  
Just make me long that much more

But I'm a man with no means to reach your distant shore

That seems to make me different from you

But they all fell down  
I've taken to the air on wings of silver  
But always hit the ground

"If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream  
Anymore  
I've tried to tell myself  
Nothing's changed my dear  
But I look around me  
And think maybe that's not so  
I only have nightmares  
  
And wake up with cold sweat  
Coming through my pores  
Why don't I dream anymore  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream  
Anymore  
We lose our patience  
Lose our trust  
Yes we lose our innocence  
  
To forget our sorrow and hide our pain  
We lose old memories  
But dreams are what life's worth living for  
I wish I could dream  
Once more  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
  
I hold it in my hand  
I open it up  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
Why don't I dream anymore  
I've tried to tell myself  
It's all for the best my dear  
  
But I look around me and think  
Maybe that's not so  
I only have nightmares  
Wake up in a cold sweat  
Have I become as corrupt  
As all I abhor  
I'm in the garden  
All the trees bear fruit  
I have to pick them before they fall  
I finally grab one  
I hold it in my hand  
  
I open it up  
It's rotten to the core  
Why don't I dream anymore  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of  
If these are the things that  
Dreams are made of

Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over  
You feel your heart beat deep down  
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain,  
Just get out

again  
You dress to impress but I got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.

You keep hearing everything that people say  
And you can't take the pain another day

You dress to impress but you can stop now  
Cuz it's gonna come back around  
And around and around and around and around

It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong (Too strong)  
To take this, take this again [Whoa]

And I believe there is a time for meditation  
In cathedrals of our own  
  
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes  
But I can only stand apart and sympathize  
For we are always what our situations hand us  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
So we'll argue and we'll compromise  
And realize that nothing's ever changed  
For all our mutual experience  
Our separate conclusions are the same  
  
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity  
Though we choose between reality and madness  
It's either sadness or euphoria  
  
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies  
Perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies  
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities  
It's either sadness or euphoria

When you turned to your friends but they were long gone  
And the sky and the snapshots remind you  
I trust you and I'm always going to miss you  
It's all a blur, it's all a blur  
Like a picture  
Reminds me who you were  
[Repeat Chorus]  
Every time I see you look at me  
I see those distant eyes and your looks are fading  
Every time you're next to me  
I want to talk and feel and act like we used to  
Cause everybody knows and everybody cares  
Until they're walking in my shoes  
And now I know  
It's you that I cannot lose  
It's all a blur  
And I owe you  
You can take it all  
When I call, pick up the phone like you used to  
It's all a blur  
Like a picture  
It's all a blur  
You're just a blur!  
I've been trying so hard just to keep away  
And now look where I am standing at today  
Trying so hard to walk away  
But it's impossible to watch you fade away  
Trying, dying so hard  
I've been denying that I'm not scarred  
I've been crying, lying so far  
But it's impossible to fill this space  
Impossible to take your place  
Impossible to watch you fade away  
Watch you fade away [x3]

Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry  
When they come for me, when I blast  
We gon see how many of em run from me  
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear  
Cause they don't love a nigga here  
[Z-Ro]  
American me, could it be my own  
War is out to murder me  
I'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die  
But have these cowards heard of me  
The rumors are real, better keep your glock cocked  
Leaving em stiffer than a statue  
Ready to defend, like a guerilla, by any  
Means that I'd murder if I have to  
Heard my homie's working as an undercover  
Ready to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces  
Could it be that I've seen my last supper  
Mighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger  
And I know you said you would strike down upon the  
With great vengeance and curious anger  
But don't attempt to poison your brother  
Was it nothing but the word of God  
That kept a nigga, from taking the lives of so many others  
And I'm trying to keep ways right, brothers and mothers  
I'm falling around a grave sight, pu-punk I hate you to death  
But yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me, and die slow  
I hate you to death, but yet I loved you so  
Wanted you to feel my pain since 91  
So brother come with me, and die slow  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Verse 2]  
As my life flashes before my eyes  
Visions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled  
Wondering why I was introduced to a life  
Filled with drama and trouble  
And everyone's always got something to say  
When I come around, when I clown  
Armed a deal, smile in my face  
And stab me in my back, when I turn around  
And I can feel hateful eyes, watching plotting to get me  
They under estimate me, hate me  
But never approach, cause they can't fade me  
And I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me  
Guerilla till I die, and I'ma blast when they come for me  
Please tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could see refuge  
Cause it seems this time we gain one, as one more elute  
Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept  
Just let me twist up, let me smoke one for the world before my last breath  
How can I go on, how can I take away my anguish  
I put a frown on my face, cause now guerillas are strangers  
And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear  
Mobbing till I die, cause they don't love a nigga here  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
Could it be I'm too good for hell  
Heaven don't want me, because I keep slippin'  
Even though I got two clips, I still preach  
Motherfuckers around had to be Christians  
And I got a problem I suppose, but I know  
I'm gon solve it with a 4-4, ten-six on fry  
And I got 25's, hollin' I roll  
But they tell me to keep my head up and finish my tape  
Because its gon jam but I'm losing respect, my music can't hang  
Around Z-Ro, just till we praying, I really don't know  
All I can say, that I don't trust nobody on this earth  
Been that away, ever since my birth  
But its gotta stay that-a-away till I'm dying  
Innocent niggas, risen up out of my business  
Is something they better do, I'ma hit the I cut  
When a fucker rolling rocks, sold em up even  
Till I got rest, gotta put it down to the bullets  
Dump a lot of bullets, till the job done  
Till a nigga really want to, kill myself  
Nigga shut the fuck up, my record is spinning  
I'm really trying to feel myself  
Gotta get em all, gotta get em dead  
When I'm filling the bed, put a infrared to the head  
Everybody come up dead, better get on or get stole on  
Nigga better get on, but I just can't hold on  
Cause I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die  
But next to steal, living on the motherfucking edge  
Nigga don't run up, because its real  
Nigga can you feel me

"If you could see inside my heart  
Then you 'd understand  
I'd never mean to hurt you  
Baby I'm not that kind of man  
  
I might not say I'm sorry  
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes  
And I might forget the little things  
Or keep you hanging on the line

Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry

I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
I'd do anything  
I'd lie for you  
You know it's true  
Baby I'd die for you  
I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
If it came right down to me and you  
You know it's true, Baby I'd die for you  
  
I might not be a savior  
And I'll never be a king  
I might not send you roses  
Or buy you diamond rings  
  
But if I could see inside you  
Maybe I'd know just who we are  
Cause our love is like a hunger  
Without it we would starve

Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry

As strangers.  
When they part they're usually  
Strangers still.

Played on us by our maker.  
Empty bottles,  
That can't be filled.  
  
You fancy me to be the master  
Of your feelings.  
You barely bruise me  
With your looks to kill.  
Though i admit we were sometimes brutal  
In our dealings,  
I never held you against your will.

And it'll blow away.  
It's blow away.  
  
Your case against me is so  
Very clearly stated  
I please no contest,  
I turn and shrug.  
I've come to figure all importance  
Overestimated.  
You must mean water when you beg for blood.

Can't watch life through a window

Doing in a life like this?  
I can't see  
What someone like me  
Is doing in a life like this  
Slipping back into the past  
  
Sun comes up and streams  
Through the blinds  
And as I throw my clothes on  
Do my hair wrong,  
Stare into my mirror  
Telling myself that everyone falls  
Take the first step  
That's the trick of it all  
Bounce back like a ball  
  
What's someone like me  
Doing in a life like this ?...

Runaway dreams  
I can't wake up  
I don't know what it means  
You see I fell asleep  
With the television on  
When I woke up it was gone  
I read my horoscope  
To see what's in store  
I get a little lazy but  
I want more, I want more

Doing in a life like this ?

And he wears them in his face  
And Macheath has got a knife  
But not in such an obvious place

As he slashes at his prey

Which gives a minimum away

Well is it plague, or is it cholera  
Or because Macky's in town?

Whose assailant's still at large  
Violated in her slumbers

Seven children had a go

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be  
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no  
So when I come home feeling tired and beat  
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet  
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd  
And all that rat-race noise down in the street  
On the roof, that's the only place I know  
Look at the city, baby  
Where you just have to wish to make it so  
Let's go up on the roof  
And at night the stars they put on a show for free  
And, darling, you can share it all with me  
That's what I said, keep on telling you  
That right smack dab in the middle of town  
I found a paradise that's trouble proof  
And if this old world starts a getting you down  
There's room enough for two, up on the roof  
Up on the roof, up on a roof  
Everything is alright, everything is alright  
Come on  
Drop what you're doin' tonight and  
Climb up the stairs and see with me, babe  
We got the stars above and the city lights below

"Papa drove a truck nearly all his life  
You know it drove mama crazy being a trucker's wife  
The part she couldn't handle was the being alone  
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone  
Papa called Mama each and every night  
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright  
Mama would wait for that call to come in  
When Daddy'd hang up then she was gone again  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined  
Papa was a good'n  
But the jealous kind  
Papa loved Mama  
Mama loved men  
Mama's in the graveyard  
Papa's in the pen  
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did  
Papa came home and it was just us kids  
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine  
If he was lookin' to surprise us, he was doin' fine  
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall  
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall  
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound  
When Papa fired it up and headed into town  
Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well  
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel  
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear  
He never hit the brakes and he was shifting gears  
Mama was a looker  
Lord, how she shined

And old home scenes of my childhood

Who'll cry for his state, we know it's too late  
I turn round to see what was meant to be  
Faint movement release to rid the disease  
  
There's innocence torn from its maker  
Stillborn, the trust in you  
I have lost all trust I had in you  
This failure has made the creator  
So would you tell him what to do?

"There are colors on the street...red, white, and blue  
People shufflin' their feet, people sleepin' in their shoes  
There's a warnin' sign in the road ahead  
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead  
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them  
So I try to forgive 'em, any way I can, yeah...  
I see a girl in the night with a baby in her hands  
Under an old street light, oh, near a garbage can  
Now she put her kid away, she's gone to get a hit  
She hates her life, and what she's done with it  
That's one more kid, that'll never go to school  
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

And by and by he'll stop and sigh  
Before his voice would even begin to speak

"Now once it was told to me  
We're born with a magic key  
It opens the door to miracles of spring  
  
It takes you to wishing wells  
To ice cream and carousels  
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face

Let your address, be sunshine place  
  
There's love and there's joy I'm told  
Much more than your heart can hold  
It's there like the ring you would grab  
On a merry-go-round  
  
The world isn't half as gray  
With friends on a rainy day  
But people keep away, when you wear a frown  
  
Unless you have a happy, ya have a happy  
Have a happy, warm smiling face

"I once had an ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Now it's gone  
Now it's gone  
  
Her name was Mary  
Purty little ice cube  
Now she's gone  
Now she's gone  
  
She was so shiny,  
My Purty little ice cube  
Now she's gone  
Where she gone?  
She's gone with the others  
The shiny little ice cubes  
Movin' on. Movin' on.  
  
She's gone  
Doesn't nothin' ever last forever?  
  
I miss my ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Since she's withdrawn  
  
I held her in my hand  
My chilly little ice cube  
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?  
  
She slipped away  
My moist little ice cube  
To oblivion, oblivion  
  
She left me standing  
With tears on my face  
On the lawn  
So I wrote this song  
  
Purty little ice cube  
Where have you gone?  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?  
  
Now she's gone  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?  
  
It's been declared  
That it's not wise  
To prize something too much  
I just wish to find something to  
Flaunt the right to  
Touch so gently  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?

And talk of days gone by  
Across the fields

And the nights grow long  
And the train  
Cries out so hauntingly

"We rode all night across an endless desert  
We had no moon to light our way  
And though a billion stars were slowly turning  
We lacked the consciences to pray  
Our horses running like devil chasers  
Those feet they hardly touched the ground  
Yes, I'm familiar with the grey wolves howling  
But I'm certain I never heard this sound  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray this cowboy song  
It's all I know  
To bring me back into your arms  
Your distant sun  
Your shining light  
You'll be my dog star shining  
Tonight  
I've been the lowest of the low on the planet  
I've been a sinner all my days  
And I was living with my hand on the trigger  
I had no sense to change my ways  
The priest asked if I'd embrace the resurrection  
To suck the poison from my life  
Just like an existential cowboy villain  
His words were balanced on my knife  
Devil to pay  
On judgement day  
Would Jesus strike me down  
If I should pray

To bring me back into your arms

Your shining light  
You'll be my dog star shining

No more rodeos  
I'd gone my last go 'round  
  
The same promise that I made  
In San Antone and Santa Fe  
But tonight I saddled up  
And let her down  
  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
  
She'll watch me drive around her block  
Gettin' courage up to stop  
To make her one more promise  
That I can't keep  
  
The way I love the rodeo  
I guess I should let her go  
Before I hurt her more  
Than she loves me  
  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away  
And I'll lose more than I'm gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin' me away

At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared

All is calm and all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from Heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ our Savior is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God  
Love's pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at thy birth

"Be-side to ""December Will Be Magic Again"" single  
Written by Kate Bush  
Warm and soothing,  
That's how I remember home.  
Walking into arms  
Through the back door.  
Hearing voices I know well,  
And long for.  
Cold and boozy,  
Our holiday in the Alps.  
Sitting in the lobby,  
Mostly smoking.  
Choking on the woozy afternoon.  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,  
My darling.  
Abrupt, too moody,  
You making our party list.  
I remember sulking  
On the sofa.  
For most of the winter  
We were strangers.  
Just one more  
To ease the ache,  
Before the night takes me.  
When you stay asleep  
On your side of the bed,  
Don't look at me,  
Don't look at you...  
I'm reeling in the music  
And I've only had a few.  
And I'm afraid  
By the way we grow old,

"I used to close my eyes and pray the time would pass me by  
So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal  
And I'd hide away from everything  
I didn't know what was real, I didn't know the truth  
There was a day when somebody introduced me to You  
And You breathed Your life in me  
You set me free  
  
Now I'll shout it from the mountain  
That I'm not the same that I used to be  
I believe in God, believe in God  
I'm not ashamed to talk about it  
To a world that slowly slips away  
That I believe in God, believe in God  
  
Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way  
I've got a friend, I've got a love that's never gonna let me go  
Since You gave Your life for me  
You set me free  
  
Oh, when I feel so alone  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
Oh, when my emotions flow  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay

"She left Oklahoma for California  
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat  
Smoke was pourin' from that old Cadillac  
But she wasn't turnin' back  
Just outside of Blackstaff  
Motor blew on her Coupe Deville  
Just in time she saw a sign  
There was a Texaco waitin' at the bottom of the hill  
  
And she said ""somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Must be angels I can't see  
Somebody must be prayin' for me"" yeah  
  
A boy 'bout twenty climbed out of a truck  
All covered in grease and dirt  
She said ""Hey Charles"" but he just laughed  
And said ""I'm wearin' my daddy's shirt""  
He stood there lost in her eyes  
And she got lost in his  
As the years roll by she would sigh  
Every time they kiss  
  
And she'd say ""somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Must be angels I can't see  
Somebody must be prayin' for me""  
  
Sometimes she stares out the window  
And wonders about her Hollywood dreams  
But when she tucks her kids in bed  
She softly whispers as they fall asleep  
  
Somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin' for me  
Ain't it funny how you always find  
Just what you need  
Somebody must be prayin' for me  
Somebody must be prayin' for me

Stained by sin but you have cleansed me

Oh, when you're alone  
You're afraid that it's true

So to let this chance  
For happiness go by  
Would be a sin  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin

That you're feeling is new  
And your heart still  
Wants to hide  
  
This feeling that  
Sends you reeling  
I'm feeling too  
It's love, it cannot be denied  
  
So take my hand  
I'll always be at your side  
There's no need  
For you to hide  
  
So listen to your heart that's  
Telling you from deep within  
Don't be afraid

But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain  
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name  
And you know I don't wanna lose that  
  
(I still believe)  
I still believe in love  
I still believe in us  
I hope you believe in us  
The way I believe in us  
  
You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak  
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya  
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I

Where the waters are green by that old Caribbean sea

While the dancers are swayin' as long as I'm playin' tune  
And if you're tappin' your feet in the beat of that native music

Pointed to the land where his fortune he'd find

"You're an adventurer  
You sail across the oceans  
You climb the Himalayas  
Seeking truth and beauty as a natural state  
You're a queen reborn  
Worshiped from above, afar  
Some see you as an elixir  
An elemental natural, seeking perfect grace  
In a catacomb  
Or cave of endless drawings  
Prehistoric or religious  
Your accomplishments prodigious  
Seeking out the perfect tone  
Your language so clear  
Your voice perfectly turning  
As in the city, I sit yearning  
Blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars  
Or driving fast in foreign cars  
To capture your remains  
You're an adventurer  
A turban wet, wrapped 'round your head  
On the mountainside, they predict your death  
Oh, how you fooled them all  
But subjects are a poor excuse  
When what you really want's a muse  
An inspirating knowledge of what comes before  
Speeds of light  
The momentary flicker of a candle in its wicker basket  
Smoking wax - facts!  
Did you find that superior knowledge that eluded you in college?  
Did you find that super vortex that could cause your cerebral cortex  
To lose its grip?  
You're an adventurer  
You were out looking for meaning  
While the rest of us were steaming in an inspirating urban pit  
An adventurer  
You enter as I'm dreaming  
I wish I'd never wake up  
Differentiating, scheming from my one true love  
You're an adventurer  
You love the angles and the cherries  
The height and width of levies  
The natural bridge and tunnels of the human race  
You're an adventurer  
Nothing seems to scare you, and if it does, it won't dissuade you  
You just will not think about it  
You dismiss it and defocus  
You redefine the locus of your time in space - race!  
As you move further from me, and though I understand the thinking  
And have often done the sane thing, I find parts of me gone  
You're an adventurer  
And though I'll surely miss you  
And of course I'll survive without you and maybe good will come of that  
But at this point I anticipate some grieving  
And although I know your leaving  
Is a necessary adjunct to what we both do

Splitting up the once was  
Splitting up the essence  
Of our star-crossed fate

Wide blue eyes  
And picky-tails swirl  
She's her daddys' girl  
'Cause he knows the jokes that always make her laugh  
He takes her for ice cream instead of her nap  
At the end of the day by the light of the moon  
They turn up the music and there in the room  
  
And she yells

There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!""

To think not so long ago that fase was mine  
Houses get smaller we take different names  
But some things in life stay the same  
  
""Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down  
There's nothin' better than bein' your girl  
And if I am your princess than daddy  
You are the king of the world!""  
  
'Cause some day she'll go off and find a life of her own  
Marry a good man  
And make a happy home  
Until she comes back and sees with those same eyes  
What time can not diskise  
  
She walks through the door with that look on her face  
Cause daddys' brown hair has all turned to gray  
They talk for hours they cry and they laugh  
Watchin' old movies and thinkin' back  
And just as she turns to go  
She says, ""hey dad, how bout 1 for the road""  
  
""Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch DOWN!  
  
""Dance me! Dance me around till my feet don't ever touch down

On the street in hushed tones  
Oh the stories they'd tell

People don't bother saying hello  
Unless somebody's born or dies  
  
And I come from a place where they  
Drag your hopes through the mud  
Because their own dreams are all dying

The sounds of the night should make us anxious  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

Where we can be together, I promise you  
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you  
I promise, I promise  
  
There's so many fighting  
To get past the Pearly Gates  
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved  
  
Their intentions aren't that good  
And I can smell the asphalt  
That's their personal road to hell being paved  
  
And when we walk down the street  
The wind sings our name in rebel songs  
But it's much to late when the fear is gone

I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you

She is so so far away

And there's a rose  
In a fisted glove  
And the eagle flies  
With the dove  
And if you can't be  
With the one you love  
Love the one your with  
Don't be angry  
Don't be sad  
Don't sit cryin'  
For good times you had  
There's a girl right next to you  
And she's waiting  
For something to do  
[Chorus:]  
Do it  
Do it  
Do it  
Turn your heartache into joy  
She's a girl and your a boy  
Get together, make it tonight,  
You ain't gonna need no more advice

Just love the one your with

"Look at us, ain't it funny  
Is it just beginner's luck, maybe...  
Ooh with just one touch  
Two different people  
From such different worlds apart  
Has touched each other's heart  
Like candle's in the dark  
So if it's time for us we gotta take it  
Take the chance, the chance to make it  
  
Now Let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what we've found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in  
Let the love begin  
  
Ooh here we are so close together  
I can feel the fire starts between us  
Ooh we've come this far  
Too far to stop it now  
If this is meant to be (it's meant to be)  
A chance for you and me (for you and me)  
We've found our destiny  
Now we're looking at a new forever  
Make this dream come true together  
  
Now let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what we've found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in

"Walk in silence,  
Don't walk away, in silence.  
See the danger,  
Always danger,  
  
Endless talking,  
Life rebuilding,  
Don't walk away.  
  
Walk in silence,  
Don't turn away, in silence.  
Your confusion,  
My illusion,  
  
Worn like a mask of self-hate,  
Confronts and then dies.  
Don't walk away.

Naked to see,  
Walking on air.  
Hunting by the rivers,  
  
Through the streets,

Set down with due care.  
Don't walk away in silence,  
Don't walk away.

"Down the side streets and the avenue  
There be sisters walkin' two by two  
Their dresses and their shoes are new  
But their hearts are weary through and through  
And it's a long way into the light of the day  
While the jukebox and the radio play  
  
Where the days turn into the nights  
People move into the sounds and sights  
Like the moth is drawn into the lights  
Like the tight-rope walker into the heights  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the sound starts pumpin'  
And the lights are flashin'  
And my hearts-a-thumpin'  
And I feel the passion  
And the world is right there waiting  
At my finger tips  
Disco... apocalypse  
  
In the dawn the city seems to sigh  
And the hungry hear their children cry  
People watch the time go by  
They do their jobs and live and die  
And in their dreams they rise above  
By strength, or hate, or luck, or love  
  
Tonight's the night I'm gonna make you mine  
Gonna dance right out onto the edge of time  
When the world starts turnin'  
And the dreams are burnin'  
And the skies awaken  
Through the wind and the fire  
They will be dancing still  
  
It's in their hearts, it's in their hips,  
It's in their feet, it's on their lips  
A single sound that never ends  
They die each night and live again  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Tonight's the night  
Out on the edge of time  
With the dreams of flesh and love dancing in my mind  
Dancing through the fire on the edge of time

"I'm gonna suture up my future  
I ain't jaded, I just hate it  
See, I've been down too long  
It's kinda hard to explain  
Gone and buried all I carried  
All my evil through a needle  
As it pulled through the eye what was  
What went on around gone  
  
Don't sweat  
Thread to forget  
To feel like you've already gone on  
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got  
Take a picture and bury it all away  
Bury it all away  
  
Tried to fake it, I just can't take it  
I don't care if it hurts  
Just so long as it's real  
I won't waste it, turned to face it  
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull  
Tried explaining, done explaining  
I got caught in a plant  
Of all this talking at once  
I've been giving my love away  
To the things that tear it apart  
I'm gonna suture up my future  
  
Thread to forget  
To feel like you've already gone on  
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got  
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away

But I'm afraid what we're heading toward is up, to you and me

There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And there's nowhere to hide

We are helpless to resist

Just a laugh, just a laugh

And so we crumble

Oh this dread circumference  
You gotta be kidding me  
The grass grows over me  
Your face in the glass, in the glass  
It was just a laugh, just a laugh  
It's whatever you say it is

Then into your life, there comes a darkness  
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky

"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants  
A three car garage, her own credit cards  
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night  
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:  
  
Buy me a rose, call me from work  
Open a door for me, what would it hurt  
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes  
These are the little things I need the most in my life  
  
Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone  
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong  
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head  
Would it make a difference if she said:  
  
Buy me a rose, call me from work  
Open a door for me, what would it hurt  
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes  
These are the little things I need the most in my life  
  
And the more that he lives the less that he tries  
To show her the love that he hold inside  
And the more that she gives the more that he sees  
This is a story of you and me  
  
So I bought you a rose on the way home from work

"Wake up every morning, heart's full of pain  
Looked out the window and it's pouring down the rain

Ain't nothin' on earth, I wouldn't do for you

Suppose I were to tell you that the meaning of dreams  
Is not all that it seems and the ultimate truth is a lie.  
And you are just a puppet who can dance on a string.  
Do you feel anything?  
Would you laugh? Would you care? Would you cry?  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery, how can anyone disagree?  
And the music is a symphony which we play in a minor key.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
So if you are confused and don't know which way to go.  
You will certainly know. From the moment we're living we die.  
And if it's all a crazy game you don't want to play  
Tell me what you can say.  
It's a joke. It's the truth. It's a lie.  
  
But the meaning of life is a mystery that we don't understand.  
And the music is a rhapsody if you're happy the way that you are.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.  
  
And the meaning of life is a mystery though we live it from day to day.  
But the music of live should be harmony so that anyone here can play.  
  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Looking at me you see yourself  
I am a mirror. I am a mirror. Every face is someone else.  
Look at me smile and you're the clown. And if I dance you turn around.  
Look in my eyes and see your tears until the music disappears.

He swept me right off my feet  
Made my life complete  
My heart skipped a beat  
'Cause he thrilled me through and through

We gonna see the preacher in the business way  
Oh I'm so happy can't you see I'm thrilled with joy?

"Tell me something that I don't already know  
Tell me how you plan to change the world  
I'm tired of people trying to tell me what is right  
I'm tired of people trying to pull me down  
  
I know that you might never understand the way I feel  
I made a promise to myself that I would never let it show  
  
Never look down  
Never look down  
Just keep my focus straight ahead  
And try to walk this line  
  
Tell me all about your favorite human being  
Tell me everything about yourself  
God, the story is so terribly interesting  
I wonder what's so good about myself  
  
I know that you might never understand the way I feel  
I made a promise to myself that I would never let it show  
  
Never look down

The room was humming harder  
As the ceiling flew away  
When we called out for another drink  
The waiter brought a tray

As the miller told his tale  
That her face at first just ghostly  
Turned a whiter shade of pale  
  
She said there is no reason  
And the truth is plain to see  
But I wandered through my playing cards  
Would not let her be

Who were leaving for the coast  
At the moment my eyes were open  
They might just as well have been closed

When you look inside and know you've been set free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
You think the only heaven you'll ever know  
Is the little bit of blue sky you see when your troubles  
Seem to go for a little while  
There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace  
When you look inside and know you've been set free, free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you  
If you just let it go  
If you just let it go  
It's waiting just for you  
If you open up your eyes  
If you realize, it's waitin' for you

The rain and storm they stumble down  
The sun disguised again today  
The wagon rolls, its axis bound  
  
Another bottle cracked today

I bought a 12 ounce coffee

And I'm weaving you a basket for Christmas

And I like my shrink  
'Cause he always brings me smoke in a pouch

We're not consumed by ambition  
We've got no mission control

But my PO says I'm delinquent and I got no incentive

Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
We'd shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys

So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary

"Never could carry a tune, never knew where to start  
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart  
  
'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again  
What else could I do again  
But keep repeating through and through  
""I love you, love you""  
  
I still recall the thrill, guess I always will  
I hope 'twill never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine

"You said goodbye  
And broke this heart inside of me  
Teardrops fell  
Like hours to eternity  
The room was silent  
As some forgotten melody  
Your words of steel  
Still echo in my memory  
  
Promises made, promises broken  
Promises made, promises broken  
  
I thought we had a chance  
To really make it last  
Now the future looks to me  
Like some unwelcome guest  
I'll be alright  
As soon as I get over you  
But this time it won't be  
Such an easy thing to do  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken  
  
Caught up in the sorrow  
Tangled in dreams  
In the lonely hours  
Of silent screams  
In the heart of the darkness  
I break down  
I feel the spirit of you  
All around  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken

"You and I were finished  
I was through with you  
Splitting up forever  
Seemed the thing to do  
I said I can't stand you  
With your honey touch  
This time you were cheating me  
One time too much  
Just then I remembered  
That a friend I knew  
Told me one thing  
I should never do  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance  
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance  
Sure there was this guy  
Right next to me  
Mine just for the asking  
He said he would be  
But to leave my man  
Seemed to me all too strange  
And I'd say that I'm glad  
I didn't make the change  
Now our life is almost  
Like a Paradise  
Let me pass on to you  
This advice  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night  
You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right  
But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool  
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool  
Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell  
Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well  
Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight  
Changing lovers in the middle of the night  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance  
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance

"I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses  
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses  
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known  
  
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds hush their
singing  
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing  
And he walks with me

Won't you come kiss me and take this despair  
Let the morning time dapple its light in your hair  
Like warm running water in snow  
  
But I feel a love of jealousy and pain  
Lost in the race 'tween the foolish and vain  
Come in the morning time whistle to take you away  
Where the sun always burns in the Winter

Oh...Here in my Heart

Come tomorrow I'll lighten-up and drink to the ones

If you leave me  
Then what would I tell them you're leaving for?

"I was missing my  
Little Miss Misty Eyes  
She made my life complete  
I'd been waiting on  
True love's sweet surprise  
And it tasted so sweet  
Oh it tasted so sweet

The sound of the love bell  
Told me all it could tell  
And the sight of

What he's looking for

Why she worships the ground that he walks on

Until he's safely home  
And she always believes his stories about working overtime  
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind

Early last summer  
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend  
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave
in  
And now he wishes he could stop himself  
But theres no easy way  
So he lays down with his lover  
And silently he prays  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God she'll never know

He knew he was playing a game he could never win  
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet  
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again  
And now he's givin up on lookin for a way  
To fight the feeling  
So he prays this simple pray  
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets

"Didn't I give it all?  
Tried my best  
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less  
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?  
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round  
Still how can you walk away  
From all my tears  
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
Maybe I should leave, to help you see  
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need  
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily  
I thought you loved me more than this  
  
But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love  
  
I will change if I must  
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust  
Oh if only, if only you knew  
Everything I do, is for you  
  
But go on and take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it, take it all with you  
Don't look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all, with my love  
Take it all with my love  
Take it all with my love

"Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her  
She tied you  
To a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
You say I took the name in vain  
I don't even know the name  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

"Traditional, adapted  
By Arlo Guthrie  
  
I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been  
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green  
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue  
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night  
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light  
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo  
It's ""Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu.

"Hear the clock strike two a.m.  
Another sleepless night for you  
Oh, i have been there too  
But there is healing in the hand of God  
He will cover everybody  
He'll even touch someone like you  
  
It's a natural thing to believe that  
Something wonderful never comes easy  
Let it go  
There is power in the cross to heal us  
There is freedom in the blood that Jesus offered to you  
So freely

Feel the wonder of it all  
Let your heart and your mind receive  
An answer to the call  
Feel the wonder of it all  
Sweet Jesus  
The love of God - the wonder of it all  
  
Another day another twist in the road  
A cloud upon your soul  
Don't let it take control  
Don't be afraid to say the name  
He's there for those who call him  
He's your refuge from the cold  
  
To love God is a curious thing  
The more you give it seems the more he brings  
His love back to you  
In the presence of the holy spirit  
Bells ringing and i can hear the angels sing  
So clearly  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
(the answer is Jesus)

By and by disappeared  
But we're safe enough behind our door

My reputation grew  
The work devoured my waking hours  
But when my time was through  
Reward of all my efforts my own  
Limited company  
  
I hardly noticed Sally as we  
Parted company  
All through the years in the end it appears  
There was never really anyone but me  
  
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe  
But no-one's there to see

My life's insanity

"Two lifes, one fate  
I have to leave  
So will you follow me?  
That's how it's meant to be  
I reigned as God  
I'm monumental  
Soon I will arise  
With you by my side  
And we will radiate the skies  
He who will gaze our lights  
Will kill his mind, his vision blind  
  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars that shine on bright  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars immortal light  
Tonight we are stars  
  
All treasures all goods  
We bury where we lay down to die  
And pay for paradise  
Await the highest thorn of all  
And who will gaze our lights  
Will kill his mind, is going blind  
  
Tonight we are stars  
Stars that shine on bright  
Tonght we are stars  
Stars inside the nights of ache  
Love and hate  
Hope and shade  
Take you away  
  
I will take you away  
I'm gonna take you away  
I'm gonna take you away

Tonight we are stars

Light of hate

"By Carole Bayer and George Fischoff  
I wanted you from the first day I saw you,  
The first day I looked into your eyes.  
That's when I knew that I would adore you.  
It was no surprise.  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I.  
  
You took my hand. Was then you had known it?  
Was that when you started loving me?  
Was it the way I smiled that had shown it?  
Was that the day you could see?  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I.  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky.  
We were made for each other

"They say ev'rything can be replaced,  
Yet ev'ry distance is not near.  
So I remember ev'ry face  
Of ev'ry man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say ev'ry man needs protection,  
They say ev'ry man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west unto the east.  
Any day now, any day now,  
I shall be released.

"You turn to the sinister when you get the boot  
Sliding down the banister in your Sunday suit  
Lying on a slag heap of blankets and magazines  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
You'd better roll over and go to sleep if you don't come clean

And in every home there will be lots of time  
I will be all yours you might have been admired  
(And in every home there will be lots of time)  
They say they're very sorry but you are not desired  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Oh heaven preserve us  
Because they don't deserve us

With an artificial limp wrist  
And so a young blade becomes a has-been  
Looking for a new twist  
  
A year after the wedding he broke all their china plates  
He's in prison now she's running with his mates  
Sees him every Sunday  
And he asks her where she's been  
She's only thirty-five going on seventeen  
She's going to cop a packet if he ever finds her  
In between the sheets

"This is how it seems to me  
Life is only therapy  
Real expensive  
And no guarantee  
So I lie here on the couch  
With my heart hanging out  
Frozen solid with fear  
Like a rock in the ground  
Woman you move me  
You give me courage I didn't  
know I had  
You move me on  
I can't go with you  
And stay where I am  
So you move me on  
This is how love was to me  
I could look and not see  
Going through the emotions  
Not knowin' what they mean  
And it scared me so much  
That I just wouldn't budge  
I might have stayed there forever  
If not for your touch  
Oh but you move me  
Out of myself and into the fire  
You move me  
Now I'm burning with love  
And with hope and desire  
How you move me  
You go whistling in the dark  
Making light of it  
Making light of it  
And I follow with my heart  
Laughing all the way  
Oh 'cause you move me  
You get me dancing and you  
make me sing  
You move me  
Now I'm taking delight  
In every little thing

With a broken arm in a broken barn, feeds the cattle.  
She hears the hens as she takes the pen,  
And it's now and now it's then [and now and then a little arab friend],  
She would saddle.  
The dip is dabbled  
  
Kissing curls and boyish girls,  
For all the pearls in all the world, wouldn't have me.  
If I had oil and money to spoil,  
I'd mix with loyal and I get some royal, little lassie.  
I'm up at nine down the line,  
To watch the time 'till half past five.  
I wish they'd sack me  
She's at home the milkman's home  
To have a farm and seeds to sow  
It makes her happy  
The chip is chappie.

And put a little boy aboard a greyhound bus  
Leaving Louisiana for the golden west

Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood

And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop

And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied  
Never thought there'd ever come a day like this  
When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss

Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love

And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks

"If I had a bird, a little bird  
I would teach that bird to sing your name  
Prettiest song that you have ever heard  
And your indifferent heart I will claim  
  
So be off, my little bird  
Fly away, fly away  
And when my love you see  
Only then, my little bird  
Cry away, cry away, and bring that heart to me  
  
If I had a moon in the sky  
I would light the world and pull the tide  
And when the moon is full like my heart  
It will surely pull you to my side  
But in the darkest night I pine away  
Pine away until your face I see  
So throw your light, my lovely moon  
Shine away, shine away, and pull his heart to me  
  
If I had a wagon made of gold  
Pretty painted horses numbered four  
With a silver harness I would hitch them up  
And drive that wagon to your door  
And if my hand you choose to hold  
Ride away, ride away with the pretty horses four  
But, darlin', if you heart's still cold  
Hide away, hide away till trouble you no more  
Trouble you no more

How temptation lured she and I  
But now I know it was only fascination  
And darling you know I wouldn't lie

Dwell on the wreckage as it smolders in the rain  
But not me, I'm alive.

"I have often dreamed  
Of a far off place  
Where a hero's welcome  
Would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer  
When they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying  
This is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday  
I can go the distance  
I will find my way  
If I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while  
When I go the distance  
I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road  
To embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander  
It will lead me to you  
And a thousand years  
Would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime  
But somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back  
I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track  
No, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope  
But I won't lose hope  
'Till I go the distance  
And my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star  
I will go the distance  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far  
I can go the distance  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms

"Butterflies danced on invisible strings  
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  
Never moan, they're happy to be working  
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain

Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high

When you got through playin' you just walked out  
I thought when you left me, that I'd lose my mind  
But now I've forgotten with a healer like time  
They said I'd forget you, I thought they were wrong  
I thought for a lifetime, my love would be strong  
But now I've forgotten and you're out of my mind  
Oh I'm so thankful for a healer like time  
  
I used to remember the dreams that we knew  
When your life was my life, your thoughts were mine too  
But since we have parted, I've forgotten by far  
Oh I'm so thankful for a healer like time

"This ol' smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to  
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied  
I just called to let you know where I'll be livin'  
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside  
I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a bar stool  
And my new home has a flashing neon sign  
Stop by and see me anytime you want to  
Cause I'm always here at home till closin' time  
  
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy  
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind  
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches

You walked out with angry words spoken

How long do old memories last

Why can't I admit it

There's always somebody tempting you  
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong  
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold  
And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold  
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple  
Man I ain't going for that  
  
I know it was her pink Cadillac

Riding in the back, oozing down the street  
Waving to the girls  
Peeling out of sight  
Spending all my money on a Saturday night  
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac  
  
Now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas  
Some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast  
But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru  
Hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do  
Anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back  
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

"Take a walk down memory lane with me  
Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need

How could I forget what you said-

""Love taking over your life""  
Was not your plan

Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done

Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done

""Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you""  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done

""To make like our Burning Bed...""

I let another man love me last night  
While he's sleepin', well, I'm cryin' here awake  
Not being loved was more than I could take  
Though it was wrong there in his arms it seemed so right  
When another man loved me last night  
Yes, another man loved me last night  
I'd almost forgotten what love was really like  
But I'm only human only a woman  
I let another man love me last night

"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

"If you see my baby  
With another man  
Keep it a secret if you can  
  
If you see my baby  
With another man  
Don't tell me even if you can  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
I hope you never see her  
With another man  
But if you do don't you understand  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
She's everything I longed for  
She took so long to find  
But I'd be lost if she changed her mind  
  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby

Hiding in plain sight  
Is your love another self-propeller perception

So we could both enjoy the show  
  
Here in the crucible  
Or could there be another explanation  
I'm not aware of  
Or should I just ignore the situation  
  
Call me in care of  
I don't know where you've been  
Your lie's is paper thin  
I see the truth erased

Though I've never let you know

The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess Ive found my way  
Its simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
Love, in and out  
Of my heart  
And though life can be strange  
I can't be afraid  
  
Searching to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess Ive found my way  
Its simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
I guess Ive found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive

you took your coat off and stood in the rain,  
You were always crazy like that  
I watched from my window,  
always felt I was outside looking in on you  
You were always the mysterious one  
with dark eyes and careless hair,  
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care  
Then you stood in my doorway, with nothing to say  
besides some comment on the weather  
Well in case you failed to notice,  
In case you failed to see,  
This is my heart bleeding before you,  
This is me down on my knees  
These foolish games are tearing me apart  
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You were always brilliant in the morning  
Smoking your cigarettes, talking over coffee  
Your philosophies on are, Baroque moved you,  
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of you loved ones  
As I clumsily strummed my guitar  
You'd teach me of honest things  
Things that were daring, things that were clean  
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.  
So I hid my soiled hands behind my back  
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you  
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else  
Somebody who gave a damn,  
Somebody more like myself  
These foolish games are breaking my heart  
your thoughtless words are breaking my heart  
You're breaking my heart  
You took your coat off and stood in the rain  
you were always like that

"I love your skin oh so white  
I love your touch cold as ice  
And I love every single tear you cry  
I just love the way you're losing your life  
  
My Baby, how beautiful you are  
My Darling, completely torn apart  
You're gone with the sin my Baby and beautiful you are  
You're gone with the sin my Darling  
  
I adore the despair in your eyes  
I worship your lips once red as wine  
I crave for your scent sending shivers down my spine  
I just love the way you're running out of life

"This is so hard for me  
To find the words to say  
My thoughts are standing still  
  
Captive inside of me  
All emotions start to hide  
And nothing's getting trough  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
So much uncertainty  
I don't like this feeling  
I'm sinking like a stone  
  
Each time I try to speak  
There's a voice I'm hearing  
And it changes everything  
  
Watch me  
Crawl from  
The wreckage  
Of my silence  
Conversation  
Failing  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls  
  
Every time you choose to turn away  
Is it worth the price you pay  
Is there someone who will wait for you  
One more time  
One more time  
  
Watch me  
Fading  
I'm losing  
All my instincts  
Falling into darkness  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
Stop me from going under  
You are the only one who knows  
I'm holding back  
  
It's not too late for me  
To keep from sinking further  
I'm trying to find my way out  
Tear down these walls for me now  
  
Tear down these walls for me  
It's not too late for me

"There's hunger in Africa,  
And anger on assembly lines.  
At the touch of a button  
I'm miles away.  
I want no connection, just information,  
And I'm gone.  
  
I feel so helpless,  
So I turn my gaze to another place.

Why try holding back the wave?  
You'll only drown in the changes.  
You've got to learn to let go.  
Just let go and experience the flight.  
Try to see from a different side..  
If balance is the key  
Maybe we'll see  
A future understanding,  
  
Then we won't feel so helpless,  
An turn away and hide from the change.

Across the oceans,

About a week before the race  
He made up his mind old shorty  
  
Would end in second place  
You know dan with his long legs flying  
He left shorty far behind  
Shorty heard him holler out  
  
Miss lucy that you'll soon be mine  
Cut across shorty ... but shorty wasn't worried  
There was a smile upon his face  
'Cause old lucy had fixed the race  
  
And just like that old story  
About the turtle and the hare  
You know that thing  
When danny crossed over the finish line

Yet here we are in heaven  
Who could wnat for more  
We always end up getting what we're asking for

And man, lookin back at these pictures of us, we were so cool  
You were so hot in your pink lipstick  
Painted on the end of a lit cigarette  
And I loved you girl, yeah, I loved you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I put it back on, I'm sixteen sittin next to you  
Down by the river you got the shivers, so I put it around you  
Were countin down the memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static  
Three polaroids, two young hearts, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
A little tattered and torn, it still keeps me warm on a Friday night  
Bandana patch from kickin some ass in a frat boy fight  
You wore it in the stands at the football games  
Some ink beneath the sleeve, I still wear your name  
And I loved you girl, yeah, I still love you girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know you grew up, I grew up, too  
You got two kids, hell, I got two kids, too  
Thank God they look like you  
  
And every night I put it back it on and Im sixteen sittin next to you  
Down by the river if you get the shivers, Ill put it around you  
Were makin them memories in the moonlight and red wine, vinyl static  
Three words, two rings, and one real cool, black, leather jacket  
  
Well, there's nothin in the world makes me feel more alive  
When its just you and me and the moon is high  
I slip into the sleeves and with your hand in mine  
I go back to the night when I fell into your eyes  
  
Two kids just fallin in love  
And here we are right now, good heavens above  
Its only gettin better, baby  
Its only getting better, baby

"Last night I heard the screaming  
Loud voices behind the wall  
Another sleepless night for me  
It won't do no good to call  
The police always come late  
If they come at all  
  
And when they arrive  
They say they can't interfere  
With domestic affairs  
Between a man and his wife  
And as they walk out the door  
The tears well up in her eyes  
  
Last night I heard the screaming  
Then a silence that chilled my soul  
I prayed that I was dreaming  
When I saw the ambulance in the road  
And the policeman said  
""I'm here to keep the peace  
Will the crowd disperse  
I think we all could use some sleep""

"Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Let me tell you, now, goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Ah, all night long you've been drinking your tequilla rye  
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry  
So why not get high, high, high and  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Goodnight sweet ladies, all ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye  
  
Ah, we've been together for the longest time  
But now it's time to get high  
Come on, let's get high, high, high  
And goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Oh, I'm still missing my other half  
Oh, it must be something I did in the past  
Don't it just make you wanna laugh  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone  
I put another record on my stereo  
But I'm still singing a song of you  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
  
Now, if I was an actor or a dancer that was glamorous  
Then, you know, an amorous life would soon be mine  
But now the tinsel light of star break  
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break  
And eleven o'clock I watch the network news  
  
Oh, oh, oh, something tells me that you're really gone  
You said we could be friends, but that's not what's not what I want  
And, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night  
One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night

"Where the sea breeze

On the way back to his boat

Met his glancing

You and Lahaina always on my mind  
  
They left the dance floor  
So they could spend more  
Precious time near the water side  
  
It wasn't wrong  
And it wasn't right  
They were two ships  
Passing in the night  
  
You know I want to  
But I can't stay (bye bye)

Driver drops him at a bar  
Called the Rinky Dink  
Jack pushes through the door  
And crosses the floor  
Tips his hat to a man  
Grinning in the corner  
Going Do da do Do da do  
Says, I'm Jangling Jack

And everything in it

Sees the dead stacked in piles  
Sees the screaming crowd  
Screams, Where am I?

Falls back down on his arse  
In a puddle of blood

So you won't forget that you are mine  
  
Don't want to care  
More than you do  
Don't want to be the one

Don't want to get that  
Call where you sound so cold  
So far away, so far away

He's not the only one to blame  
Between the jobs and the kids  
Wasn't much time for him

Guess I shouldn't be surprised  
But as hard as I try  
I can't believe it's happened to me  
But I know where he's at  
And I know it's a fact  
I'd have to be blind not to see

And where that leaves me God only knows  
I know I should tell him  
To leave me forever  
But what'll I do if he goes  
  
Should I put up a fight  
Does it matter who's right  
Should I ruin my life or my pride  
Can we save what we had  
And if he comes back  
Will I ever get it out of my mind

I know that I ain't very bright  
Just to tag along  
Oh, but right or wrong  
I'm his and I'm here  
And I'm gonna be his friends or his lover

To wake him and make him discover  
That he needs me

"The chapter is opened and the pages are turned  
The writting say many things but who was concerned  
  
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?  
When it's lost gone forever  
  
For years they told me what I should to do  
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to  
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth  
And it feels good to me  
  
The world is turnin'  
Forever turnin'  
Forever yearnin'  
For the love of life  
And you're wrong if think that I'm afraid to love  
  
I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you  
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?  
  
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?  
When it's lost it's gone forever

But I've never felt so sure  
I wish I had the answer to give  
Don't even have the cure

Knowing as you leave me  
I also lose my heart

Knowing as you leave me

To Dublin I'd roam  
She was a bareback rider

Hung in the sky  
Cutting through time like a memory  
Strung on a wire  
The color of anything  
Fades in the air  
But she is the film of a book of the story  
Of the smell of her hair

And every thing's clear

And no one is here

I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
You'll remember one day...

Thought I'd got him out of my life  
But I agreed to see him just one time  
Never thought I'd fall for him twice

I can't think of living without you  
I'd understand if that's what you'd want to do

Secrets that you never know  
Secrets in a private room  
Secrets that I kept from you

Never wanted to hurt you  
Didn't really want to deceive  
I was so afraid if I told you  
Your broken heart would force you to leave  
I think I knew what I was doing  
By falling into his arms again  
I wish I'd seen right through him  
But I'm telling you 'cause I'm so ashamed

The face you wore was cool  
You were a photograph  
When it's all too late

Is this what you deserve

"There was a place in East St. Louis, it was in  
Nineteen fifty nine, when they played they filled  
The streets with music, that lonely blue note music  
That takes your cares away, far away  
They packed the place when the band was playin'  
To get some joy from a smoke filled room, through that door  
You could see the bodies swayin', the blue note band  
Was playin' some lonely blue note song all night long  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
No place I'd rather stay  
If you should ever make it to St. Louis on some hot  
And lonely night, if you listen you can hear  
That blue note music, they fill the streets with music  
It carries you away, far away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away  
Oh, it carried me away, oh carried me away

"Born in the country and I like that country smile  
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child  
That I knew and a big harvest moon  
That shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon  
And I need to be there when the autumn wind goes  
Singing through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
Born in the country and I like that country song  
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town  
And I bought you a dime diamond ring  
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings  
And I need to be there when the world  
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
Born in the country and I like that country way  
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play  
While the young ones slept overhead  
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said  
And I need to be there when the autumn wind  
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
And I need to be there when the world  
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time

I've tried to make it on my own. I'm not trusting You.

Her face is etched with memories  
She finds now joy amid the sleaze

The beauty of an empty bed  
She dreams of happy days instead  
Of brooding on to-morrow

For pushers, bars and money fights  
For nameless faces in red light  
So she turns her head to the pillow

She's heard the jokes and jibes before  
She's felt the long arm of the law  
So she turns her head to the pillow

It made her feel like going on  
But now she hurts when its all gone

Sweet life force flows from within  
The white clouds in her head grow dim  
And she turns her head to the pillow

Fear the way we die  
It can make the mountains ring  
Make the angels cry  
So the bird is on the wind

Hey people now, smile on your brother  
Let me see you get together  
And love one another  
Some may come and some may go  
We will surely pass  
Will the one who left us here  
Return for us at last?  
We are but a moment's sunlight  
Fading in the grass

Let me see you get together  
And love one another  
If you hear the song I'm singing  
You will understand  
You hold the key to love and fear  
All in your trembling hand  
Just one key unlocks them both

Throws a dark eye back to sea

As if might and will make right  
Or either one could make us free  
As if might and will make right

They're weaving out into the street  
It seems we never were so young  
Or it was never quite so sweet  
But the world is always beautiful  
When it's seen in full retreat  
The worst of life looks beautiful  
As it slips away in full retreat  
  
God only knows that we can we do  
No more or less than he'll allow  
God only knows that we mean well  
God knows that we just don't know how  
But I try to be your light in love  
Pray that is enough for now  
Well I tried to be your light in love  
And I'll pray that is enough for now

"A little stretch of river on a big green field  
The kind you see from airplanes baby, that's the deal, that's the deal  
A place to plan a future, a place to keep the past  
A place to raise some kids, and what's wrong with that, wrong with that  
  
Maybe it's the same routine  
Walking on the concrete  
Running like a river so deep  
Wearin' down my high heels  
Wearin' down my high ideals  
Of what I thought my life was supposed to be  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
I want to paint the world with the colors that I see  
Every time I close my eyes and you're kissin' me, kissin' me  
I wanna wake up in your arms so far from here  
I wanna get lost in the dark and know you're near, know you're near  
  
Maybe it's an old love song playing up loud on the radio bringin' these
thoughts on  
Getting me thinking that there might be a little bit more than what I'm
working for  
Or maybe it's just me

Sharing the blame.  
But when she was dying

There's no use cryin'  
It can't help her now.

I had so little time to fail

And I'm in the shade

Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you  
With the rain blowing in your hair.

It was you who came right through  
It was you who understood  
Though I'd never say

That you'd have liked me to

"As I was out walking on the corner one day  
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay  
His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor  
I guess he'd been there for a whole night or more  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leaving nobody to carry it on  
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
A blanket of newspaper covered his head  
The step was his pillow  
The street was his bed  
One look at his face  
showed the hard road he'd come  
and a fistful of money  
showed the coins that he'd bummed  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone  
  
Does it take much of a man  
to see a whole life go down  
To look on the world  
from a hole in the ground  
Too late for your future  
like a horse that's gone lame  
To lie in the gutter  
and die with no name  
  
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone  
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin' nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

See me, see you, see through, emcee's who knew  
  
Fly like the wind, I hang like a hinge  
Been gone like rhymes on a drinkin binge  
So don't cringe at the sight of Rock  
Ya want to fight the rock, ya gotta fight this glock  
  
And you can say my beats are fake  
But it don't mean shit when your gettin paid

You know My name is Rock [Repeat: x 7]  
  
I'm the D to the O, P to the D  
O to the straight up G see  
I been around like Jesus layin tracks  
But I had to come back, I had to come back  
  
Back from the dead, enough said  
Still trippin like Fred  
Be red, ya got a head full of holes  
I got a head full of bowls  
  
I'm the K-I straight from the D, punk  
From the home of the be funk  
Ain't no frontin here, I won't disapear  
I'll be around next year

"Eye on the TV  
Cause tragedy thrills me  
Whatever flavor it happens to be  
Like  
Killed by the husband""  
""Drowned by the ocean""  
Shot by his own son  
She used a poison  
In his tea  
And kissed him goodbye  
That's my kind of story  
It's no fun until someone dies  
  
Don't look at me like  
I am a monster  
Frown out your one face  
But with the other  
Stare like a junkie  
Into the TV  
Stare like a zombie  
  
While the mother holds her child  
Watches him die  
Hands to the sky crying,  
""Why, oh why?""  
  
Cause I need to watch things die, from a distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all need it too, don't lie  
  
Why can't we just admit it?  
Why can't we just admit it?  
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing  
Neither the brave nor bold  
Were writers of the stories told  
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing  
  
I need to watch things die... from a good safe distance  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
You all feel the same, so  
  
Why can't we just admit it?  
  
Blood like rain come down  
Drum on grave and ground  
  
Part vampire  
Part warrior  
Carnivore and voyeur  
Still have the transmitter  
Synched to the death rattle  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie (x4)  
  
Credulous at best  
Your desire to believe in  
Angels in the hearts of men  
Pull your head of your hippie haze, and give a listen  
Shouldn't have to say it all again  
  
The universe is hostile, so impersonal  
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been  
  
We all feed on tragedy  
It's like blood to a vampire  
  
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies  
Much better you than I

"Drive by my house late at night  
You can see from the freeway above  
No silhouette, but a light left on  
Burning there for love  
smoke is rising from the fire  
Coming out my back door  
I'm inside, sound asleep  
Cigarette on the floor  
Burning there for love  
well I can still remember  
A couple of years ago  
When the smoke and flame called my name  
It was a burning house of love  
that rusty nail over our front door  
Is where I hung our tears in the rain  
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds  
To see what luck can bring  
cause you're in your bed, I'm in mine  
On either side of town  
I think I might take a ride  
And burn your love house down

In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the

I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood
fall

"In 1803 we sailed out to sea  
Out from the sweet town of Derry  
For Australia bound if we didn't all drown  
And the marks of our fetters we carried  
In our rusty iron chains we cried for our weans  
Our good women we left in sorrow  
As the mainsails unfurled, our curses we hurled  
On the English, and thoughts of tomorrow  
  
At the mouth of the Foyle, bid farewell to the soil  
As down below decks we were lying  
O'Doherty screamed, woken out of a dream  
By a vision of bold Robert dying  
The sun burned cruel as we dished out the gruel  
Dan O'Connor was down with a fever  
Sixty rebels today bound for Botany Bay  
How many will meet their reciever

Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry  
Oh... I wish I was back home in Derry

Our ship danced like a moth in the firelight  
White horses rode high as the devil passed by  
Taking souls to Hades by twilight  
Five weeks out to sea, we were now forty-three  
We buried our comrades each morning  
In our own slime we were lost in a time  
Of endless night without dawning

To end out his whole life in slavery  
Where the climate is raw and the gun makes the law

My comrades ghosts walk behind me  
A rebel I came - I'm still the same  
On the cold winters night you will find me

Are turning hidden wheels,  
Causing things to come about

All invisible from where we stand,

They affect us nonetheless, yes.

And the children will dance

With nothing left to chance.

The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe
as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what
their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He
would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him.  
  
With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue
and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to
find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King.

"The prisoner meets the Muppet hi-fi  
North of Watford junction  
We get in but we don't have fun  
An' we leave before the truncheons  
So it's back to watch the day to day  
Saga of working people  
Hanging out the washing and clipping coupons  
And generally being decent  
  
Johnny too bad meets johnny be good  
In the Charing Cross Road  
That's the only thing that happened today  
Says the west end jungle code  
And all the Germans and all the French  
Jam themselves down the tube  
And re-enact the second world war  
While the rude boys get rude!  
  
And I look to my left  
And I look to my right  
And I'm looking for a man  
I'm looking for a sign  
I don't want to be the prisoner  
  
The prisoner lives in Camden Town  
Selling revolution  
The prisoner loads his tracking arm up  
With self-disillusion  
Your mother does the washing up  
Your old man digs the garden  
You're only free to dodge the cops  
An' bunk the train to stardom

"L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time  
And the feeling is ""lay back""  
Palm trees grow and rents are low  
But you know I keep thinkin' about  
Making my way back  
Well I'm New York City born and raised  
But nowadays  
I'm lost between two shores  
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home  
New York's home  
But it ain't mine no more  
  
""I am""...I said  
To no one there  
And no one heard at all  
Not even the chair  
""I am""...I cried ""I am""...said I  
And I am lost and I can't  
Even say why  
Leavin' me lonely still  
  
Did you ever read about a frog  
Who dreamed of bein' a king  
And then became one  
Well except for the names  
And a few other changes  
If you talk about me  
The story's the same one  
But I got an emptiness deep inside  
And I've tried  
But it won't let me go  
And I'm not a man who likes to swear  
But I never cared  
For the sound of being alone  
  
""I am""...I said  
To no one there  
And no one heard at all  
Not even the chair  
""I am""...I cried  
""I am""...said I

Even say why

For once unafraid

And somehow I know I'll be strong

Someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true

Not like it's hurt me before

Of a girl who once lived in this land  
A girl who was once my sweetheart,  
She was know as The Blue Velvet Band.  
  
On her cheeks was the first flush of nature,  
Her beauty, it seemed to expand,  
Her hair hung down in long tresses,  
Tied back with a blue velvet band.  
  
I can still see those tears as we parted,  
Of my heart broken Blue Velvet Band  
As I left I told her I'd never  
Come back to my old home again.  
  
Five years on the wide open spaces  
Was all that my poor heart could stand,  
Every night as I lay on my pillow,  
I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band.  
  
Then one night as I lay down dreaming  
Of home and poor mother and dad,  
Like a flash by my bedside was standing  
The form of my Blue Velvet Band.  
  
I started next day for my darling,  
Just to go back and make her my bride  
But as I reached the old country depot,  
They told my my sweet heart has died.  
  
They laid her to rest in the churchyard,  
Midst the sweet summer flowers of the land  
On her finger the ring I had bought her,  
On her head was a blue velvet band.

In this context, a concave nest  
How do we learn to hurt?  
Do you mean there's no variation?

As the crow implies, we won't be missed  
We can leave, we can leave, we can leave, you leave  
It's a routine flight for this bird tonight  
There's more worms than earth in the after life  
Where the blind feed the blind, whispering things like  
""On the money"" and ""Bullseye""  
She picks up the little leaves  
Where human wrecks are left to seed  
Left to repaint their deities  
And plaster away at their villainies  
Where there's love and there's hope  
And do you hope those earthbound poets  
Could learn to sing as good as us?  
So we can sit back and enjoy our illusions and our quietus?  
Well I don't know but why suppose  
It's not the way it should be  
When you can squawk and wait for a word from above  
And change yourself into something you love when you leave?

When your head is on the scaffold  
'N your ass is on the line  
You gotta give it that old religion

They can buy the hero in you  
For a dime

In your old kit bag  
Say goodbye to your mother

Long may they reign  
May they live long enough  
To feel every single pain

They don't give no reasons why  
They just keep on making medals

With an engineer that's brave  
We must make this run successful  
From the cradle to the grave  
Heed the curves and watch the tunnels  
Never falter, never fail  
Keep your hands upon the throttle  
And your eye upon the rail  
Blessed Saviour there to guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
And the angels there to join us  
In God's grace forevermore  
As you roll across the trestle  
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide  
You will reach the Union Depot  
Into which your train will ride  
There you'll meet the superintendent  
God the father, God the son  
With a happy joyous greeting  
Weary pilgrim, welcome home  
Blessed Saviour there to guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
And the angels there to join us

As she buys her papers at the cornershop,  
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,  
Cos in her dreams she is faraway, far away

"Gather round me boys and fill your coffee cups  
I'll tell you all a story while you drive them trucks  
A story bout a girl who joined the state patrol  
The legend of the Lady Bear is how it goes  
She married some young trucker she was in her teens  
And like all newly weds they had their hopes and dreams  
And one night in a snowstorm so the story went  
She lost her loving husband in an accident  
They say she sat and cried for him a year or more  
And all she did was think of him and walk the floor  
She'd lie there in her bed at night alone and cold  
Until one day she joined the highway state patrol

Well they say she has a CB and she's on the air  
And she goes by the handle of the Lady Bear

I've heard some truckers say there ain't no Lady Bear  
And others say she don't work when the weather's fair  
But when the weather's bad she's on the air all night  
Begging us to slow down till the weather's right  
Well you know I love this story well it could be true

If you should hear the Lady Bear on your radio  
Well tell her I wrote this song and said hello

To deduct our future taxes  
And we flock to bars for drinking  
Though one never quite relaxes  
And we compromise our standards

Are the things we never mention

Now I know God is up in heaven  
Its hard to keep in mind  
Sometimes when youre searching for relief  
And hell is all you find  
And I know that I'm a romantic  
I might seem a fool to say  
I'm know I'm going to see a few hands joined  
Before my dying day

Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you

Where Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand  
And the first to do time,

First of the gang with a gun in his hand

And the bullet in his gullet and the first lost lad to go under the sod  
  
And he stole from the rich and the poor  
And the not very rich and the very poor.

He stole our hearts away,

They turn it up, and you know

Work on the one who shows the first sign of pity

"The old hometown looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
And down the road I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
And then suddenly I awake and look around me  
At these cold grey walls that surround me  
And it's then that I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there stands a guard and there's the sad old padre  
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak  
And once again I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home...

"One evening getting dark  
We first met at the park  
Just sitting by the fountain all alone  
I lifted up my hat  
And then began to chat  
She said she'd allow me to see her at her home  
Chorus:  
Such a star I've never seen  
She's as pretty as the queen  
She's as perfect as an angel from above  
If she'd only be my wife  
I'd live happy all me life  
With that aggravating beauty lulu walls.  
If she were only mine  
I'd build a house so fine  
And around it so many fences tall  
It would make me jealously  
To think that none but me  
Could gaze upon that beauty lulu walls.  
Repeat chorus:  
One evening getting late  
Well, I met her at the gate  
I asked her if she'd wed me in the fall  
But she only turned away  
And nothing would she say

Every day I sent another present  
Just to let her know how very much I care  
I wrote a little love note with each present  
But it didn't seem to get me anywhere  
  
My poor worried heart was almost certain  
That this love affair would never be  
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and  
From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing, the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses, roses, roses, I thank you for saying what I couldn't say  
Oh, what a wonderful way to tell her ""I love you"" each day  
With roses and roses and roses of love

I thought that I knew everything  
I could make it in this scene  
To be a rising star that only gleamed  
But all the answers disagreed  
With the questions held for me  
I was legal now at twenty-one  
  
I knew the way the world should run  
My God just look what I had done  
Simply drunk and having fun  
Looked for friends, but I found none  
All alone at twenty-one

That I was still even half alive  
Somehow I managed to survive  
I felt my body's doing time  
And In my back a hundred knives  
From friends at twenty-five

I'd buy your life, if you would sell  
A year or two, if less compelled  
So live your life and live it well

"Making love in an ice cold room  
We start 'til the candle burns - gone  
Kissing each other 'til the moon says bye-bye  
And the sun says hello  
  
Lying here with no blanket  
The room's temperature is sub-zero  
Baby bring your body closer  
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, (keep) on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Sweat drippin' up our bodies, breathin' small  
While you're whispering to me  
Ice crystal in this small, small bed  
But we make frost when we're touching like that.  
  
Laying here with no blanket  
The room's temperature is sub-zero  
Baby bring your body closer  
'Cause you keep me warm when you're naked

Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer
burn)  
Let's keep on, keep on freezin'  
Hold me tight, oh I'm not leavin'  
Let's keep on loving 'til we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
  
Snowflakes at the tip of my fingers.  
Frozen in time, our love lingers  
Livin' in a world so cold,  
Sometimes our hearts are just like icicles  
  
Being with you is all I need  
There's nothing we can't handle babe  
Lay on my chest, please cover me  
Deep frost, on this bed memories  
  
Let's feed on love until we get freezer burn (freezer burn, freezer burn)  
Making out in this ice box 'til we get feezer burn (freezer burn, freezer

"Seven forty two in the morning  
Eight seconds before it all sinks in  
Put your best face on for the world  
Fake another smile and just pretend  
But you're just puttin' off the pain  
Nothing's ever really gonna change  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
And let it hurt  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
Three twenty eight in the morning  
Countin' up the spaces between the rain  
You're gettin' used to the rocks at the bottom  
Your heart goes numb, but the lonely stays the same  
And that's the price you're bound to pay  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
Oh, there's only just one way  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
You might just find you're better for it  
When you let go and you learn  
To let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Oh  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
And let it hurt

"I whispered you  
Words I thought I'd never say  
We played the game  
But then we tossed the rules away  
Could deny it  
Justify it  
But we both know we went too far  
Oh, I can feel you  
And I need you  
No matter wherever you are  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to watch my love come crashing down  
But I can't lie to my heart  
I don't really want your memory hangin' 'round  
But baby I just can't lie to my heart  
  
I have loved you  
Longer than you've even known  
When you hurt I hurt  
I'm your flesh and you're my bone  
If I could only  
Be two people  
Darlin' I swear we'd both be with you  
Oh, I know I'm selfish  
But I'm helpless  
I want you and nothing else will do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't pretend anymore  
Been hiding too long  
I won't go on like before  
I'm not that strong  
I can feel it when I'm near you  
It's not healthy to need you this way  
Try to fight it, get inside it  
But this pain is stronger than me and it won't go away

"Looky here, who's in focus now  
Hard and clear to the bone  
No more fears that you'd notice now  
Like a tear cast in stone  
And she comes from a spring to a fountain  
On the wings of her song  
She's the king of the mountain  
She's so good, Lord, and she's gone  
Cause she's a star-see her shining  
She'll go far, for a price  
But she's hard in the heart like a diamond  
Flashin' fire--cold as ice

"The sun came up exposed the cloud the city put up  
Grey mountains lost grey skies covered them up  
So what if we can make a million cars in one day  
Or a million bombs to blow ourself up  
Should we call this free?  
The answer's obvious decisions made for and against us  
The sun came up behind the trees on the city it looks so ugly to me  
A million people a million dreams  
But not a word spoken it seems  
I'll be a friend to you be a friend to me  
The bosses learned to fool the slaves into 8 hour days  
But do we need them or do they need us?  
It seems like we dwell on these useless things  
Life-styles of wealth pursuit of money  
Competition says to beat each other down for personal gain  
Sorry I didn't call last night, I've got a lot of nothing taking all my time  
Motivation sometimes sinks deep in the couch cushions  
Sometimes sleep is my best friend  
And it hurt me when my friends transformed into my parents  
They don't call here anymore so it all comes down to this turn  
18 find life employment shut your mouth cover your eyes  
I think we deserve a bit more than this  
Do you really think you run your life?  
And when all the skies turn grey and the earth rejects this mess we've made  
And all the cities fallt ot he sea  
When every person has the means to build a life, follow their dreams  
And not be worked into their grave  
When all governments  
And multi-million dollar corporations have been torn down  
By commen men, when it all falls down

There's an answer to your prayer  
And I swear that there'll come a day, yeah

"It's another night in hell  
Another child won't live to tell  
Can you imagine what it's like to starve to death  
  
And as we sit free and well  
Another soldier has to yell  
Tell my wife and children I love them in his last breath  
  
C'mon now amen, amen, amen  
  
Habitual offenders, scumbag lawyers with agendas  
I'll tell you sometimes people I don't know what's worse  
Natural disasters or these wolves in sheep clothes pastors  
Now damn it I'm scared to send my children to church  
And how can we seek salvation when our nations race relations  
Got me feeling guilty of being white  
But faith in human nature, our creator and our savior, I'm no saint  
But I believe in what is right  
  
C'mon now amen, amen  
I said amen, amen  
  
Stop pointing fingers and take some blame,  
Pull your future away from the flame  
Open up your mind and start to live  
Stop short changing your neighbors  
Living off hand outs and favors, and maybe  
Give a little bit more than you got to give  
  
Simplify, testify, identify, rectify  
And if I get high stop being so uptight  
It's only human nature and I am not a stranger  
So baby won't you stay with me tonight  
  
[INSERT JAPANESE TRANSLATION]  
  
It's a matter of salvation from them patience up above,  
So don't give up so damn easy on the one you love, one you love  
Somewhere you got a brother, sister, friend, grandmother, niece or nephew  
Just dying to be with you  
You know there's someone out there who unconditionally, religiously, loves you  
So just hold on 'cause you know it's true  
And if you can take the pain  
And you can withstand anything, and one day  
Stand hand in hand with the truth  
  
I said amen, I said amen  
I said amen, I said amen,  
  
Amen

"When people say, you're not my kind  
And that your clothes are out of line  
And that your hair isn't combed all the time  
You're not real pretty but you're mine  
  
We have a great big old society  
That won't make room for folks  
Like you and me  
But I got some real sad news  
For them my friend  
They're on the outside looking in  
  
We've got a great thing going  
And it's gonna keep right on growing  
And I hope that soon they'll see the light  
But until that time  
They'll have to blow their mind  
Cause it ain't us that's gonna lose this fight  
So when we're walking I don't care  
When all those people stop and stare  
If they'd look in your eyes they'd see  
You're not real pretty but you belong to me

And when I hold you baby

"It's been a mystery  
But still they try to see  
Why something good can hurt so bad  
Caught on a one-way street  
The taste of bittersweet  
Love will survive somehow, somewhere  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
So many stormy nights  
So many wrong or rights  
Neither could change their headstrong ways  
And in a lover's rage  
They tore another page  
The fighting is worth the love they save  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
Only so many tears you can cry  
'Til the heartache is over  
And now you can say your love,  
Will never die

"That night will live forever  
Their first time to lie together  
They were finally where desire dared them to go  
Both belonging to another  
But longing to be lovers  
Promising each other that the night will only know  
Parked on some old backstreet  
They laid down in the back seat  
And fell into the fire down below  
But they would pay for their deceiving  
For a deadly web was weaving  
Why they picked that spot that evening  
Lord, the night will only know  
Well within the innuendos  
Just outside the steamy windows  
The night was shattered by a woman's scream  
Motionless and frightened  
The grip of fate had tightened  
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam  
They saw a woman pleading  
Stumbling, begging and retreating'  
Til she became the victim of her foe  
And they watched her fall in silence  
To save their own alliance  
But the reason for the violence  
Just the night will only know  
And every paper ran the story  
She was stripped of all her glory  
And the told exactly how the woman died  
Abandoned and forsaken  
Too many pills were taken  
And they ruled the woman's death a suicide  
Bound by their behavior  
They could have been her savior  
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe  
But another crime was committed  
And it's never been admitted  
Have the guilty been acquitted  
Lord, the night will only know

Don't leave me hanging on the telephone

Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation  
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection

"Oh! Mama, Mama look there!  
Your children are playing in that street again  
Don't you know what happened down there?  
A youth of fourteen got shot down there  
The Kokane guns of Jamdown Town  
The killing clowns, the blood money men  
Are shooting those Washington bullets again  
  
As every cell in Chile will tell  
The cries of the tortured men  
Remember Allende, and the days before,  
Before the army came  
Please remember Victor Jara,  
In the Santiago Stadium,  
Es verdad - those Washington Bullets again  
  
And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961,  
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun,  
For Castro is a color,  
Is a redder than red,  
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead  
For Castro is the color...  
...That will earn you a spray of lead  
  
For the very first time ever,  
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua,  
There was no interference from America  
Human rights in America  
  
Well the people fought the leader,  
And up he flew...  
With no Washington bullets what else could he do?  
  
'N' if you can find a Afghan rebel  
That the Moscow bullets missed  
Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist...  
...Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet,  
How many monks did the Chinese get?  
In a war-torn swamp stop any mercenary,  
'N' check the British bullets in his armory  
Que?

Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo  
  
Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, ""You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!"" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""  
  
The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy  
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
(Oh, you sing it with me,)

"I once upon a time  
Carried a burden inside  
Some will ask goodbye  
A broken line but underlined  
There's an ocean of sorrow in you  
  
Sorrow in me  
  
Saw movement in their eyes  
Said I no longer knew the way  
Given up the ghost  
A passing minds and its a fear  
And the wait for redemption ahead  
  
Waiting to fade  
  
Fading again  
  
If death should take me now  
Count my mistakes and let me through  
Whisper in my ear  
Taken more than we've received  
And the ocean of sorrow is you

Bubblebaths at night  
Breakfast in the afternoon  
Love by candlelight

I remember romance  
And lying in her arms  
Her hair across my shoulder  
Her breast upon my arm

I remember romance  
And laughing at the moon  
Dancing at the rainbow's end  
And losing her too soon

I know we both still care  
Oh how could we have lost it

"[Fabolous]  
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a f-ck  
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck  
If you're cool being taken down and giving up  
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!  
I done felt pain, waited but no help came  
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane  
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain  
Ever been told ""go to hell"" and felt flames  
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper  
It's all down hill and it only gets steeper  
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper  
  
It cost to be the boss, it aint get no cheaper  
But there's a man above that we all under bro  
No bread truck but he work wonders though!  
After you wake up, everything is wonderful  
You can overcome anything you undergo  
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture  
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you  
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses  
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches  
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses  
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches  
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?  
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious  
So I sold weed and crack, business  
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious  
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses  
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness  
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business  
Beef is only good when you in the burger business  
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal  
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will  
But for real you loaded up to kill  
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will  
And I don't owe these niggas nothing  
Put that in a nigga will

Hymns of faith that made us strong  
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us  
Hear the angels sing along

Turn 'round and put himself in front of you  
Sometimes it's fun  
But then you never know  
How far a thing like this might go

Waited for a chance  
To get right out of here  
And when I had it in my hands

Extracting tensions from sources unknown

You may achieve what can't be simply done  
Look back and there you are where we have been  
And still there's so much in between  
  
All those years I've travelled 'round this world  
Now I am standing here  
To make you sing these tunes  
And know they'll never let you go

Into the pouring rain  
I wish I could tell you  
That I stopped hearing your name  
And then I realize every thought of you  
Runs a circle around my heart  
I hear your voice haunting me  
I feel your touch in the dark  
  
It was a night to remember  
All your kisses I still taste  
It was a night to remember  
Can't forget the look on your face  
It was a night

Like a beacon into the night  
To tell you I'm lonely  
When I shut out the light  
Because a part of me left with you  
So I feel lost inside  
Sometimes I look into my mirror  
I see you shining through my eyes  
  
It was a night to remember  
All your kisses I still taste  
It was a night to remember  
Can't forget the look on your face

From my heart

Around my shoulders  
I cannot free this restless heart

(I) Prelude  
  
""Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless.""

Oh Emerald  
If you could only see the view from my eyes  
Then you'd know how far I've gone for you  
But you look the other way  
But you don't mean to act so cruel  
And I don't mean to punish you  
Must this be the life we choose  
I don't want to be a slave to you  
I just want to be true  
We don't mean to act so cruel  
And I don't mean to punish you  
Must this be the life we choose  
I don't want to be a slave to you  
I just want to be true

"Stay in my heart where I lead you  
Stay where a kiss won't mislead you  
Don't ever think of going far  
You'll have me following where you are  
  
Stay where my arms can reach for you  
Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go  
You'll like it better if you stay

Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

Fading while your world is crumbling

A life of crimes not easy, sometimes you need some help  
Someone to share the risks with, and to help you spend the wealth  
Some one to run the shredder, or to help you dig a hole  
But lying on the witness stand's the most important role  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
When I come home at night With blood up to my elbows,  
Skin beneath my fingernails, and brains stuck to my toes,  
Let's get the story straight because the cops are on their way  
Just sit tight, and listen, and I'll tell you what to say.  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
Don't ask any question about the money in the closet  
You'll get your share later just foget you ever saw it  
Share and share alike, that's the way it's gotta be,  
Even if it's gonna make you an accessory  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you  
Be my alibi!  
Where was I on the fifth of May?  
I was here with you all day  
Tell the pigs to go away  
Be my alibi!  
I'm gonna be indicted for that last bank robbery  
You've got to tell the jury that it really wasn't me  
Just remember what to say when you're on the stand  
I'm sure that everything will go exactly like we planned  
Show me that you love me true  
You know I can't help what I do  
You know I'd do the same for you

"Back through the years  
I go wandering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall the box of rags  
Someone gave us  
And how my mama put the rags to use  
There were rags of many colors  
Every piece was small  
And I didn't have a coat  
And it was away down in the fall  
Mama sewed the rags together  
So in every piece with luck  
She made my coat of many colors  
That I was so proud of  
As she sewed, she told a story  
From the Bible she had read  
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore  
And then she said,  
Perhaps this coat  
Will bring you good luck and happiness  
And I just couldn't wait to wear it  
And my mama blessed it with a kiss  
My coat of many colors  
That my mama made for me  
Made only from rags  
That I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money  
Well, I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colors  
I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing  
And making fun of me  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
And no, I couldn't understand it  
For I felt I was rich  
And I told them all the story  
Mama told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colors  
Was worth more than all their clothes  
But they didn't understand it  
And I tried to make them see  
""But one is only poor  
Only if he chooses to be.""  
Now I know we had no money  
In my coat of many colors  
My mama made for me  
Made just for me

Buford: I've highlighted your parts. Now sing along.  
  
Buford: Santa Claus and all his elves  
Are making gifts for Buford  
Baljeet: I don't think that's how it goes  
Buford: Nobody's askin' you, nerd  
  
Baljeet: Buford! You're completely disrespecting this classic song. You're  
Ignoring the historical context. King Wenceslas was a great man. You have  
No idea what this song is about!  
Buford: I know all about this song.  
  
Buford: The words were by an English guy  
The music, Scandanavian  
Wenceslas was five-foot-six  
He kept his face unshaven  
Though just a duke throughout his life  
He always ruled so justly  
His kingly title was conferred  
Upon him posthumously  
  
Baljeet: Well, I stand corrected. You seem to have a lot of information.  
But if you know so much about it, why do you not sing the original song?  
Buford: I like my version better. It's about me!  
  
Buford: Buford should get lots of gifts  
Every Christmas season  
When I see presents just for me  
It always is so pleasin'  
That is why I changed the words  
To make the song more edgy  
If you don't like the way I sing  
You'll get a Christmas wedgie

"The heart of the ocean told me, you're the only one  
You're like a rose in the snow, and you need the sun  
And my heart is crying, when your love is dying  
What have I got to do  
And I'm tossing and turning, my heart is burning  
We're more than two  
  
You're my cosmic girl, you are in my mind  
And a girl like you, is so hard to find  
You're my cosmic girl, from rainbow two  
And to hell and back, I will go for you  
Oh cosmic girl come hear my heart  
I'll never try to break apart  
Oh cosmic girl, give me some time  
I swear you're always on my mind  
  
You are like the sunshine and I kiss away the rain  
I tell you I miss you baby can't we be friends  
Let's stay together, here and forever  
It's good for me, good for you  
The heart of the ocean, is always in motion  
What can I do?

"Imagining you're far away  
Searching for the words to say  
I feel it when you fall apart  
Our lives are our greatest art  
I don't want to change your mind  
'Cause I accept you  
For everything you are and will be  
Stay here with me now  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
You don't ever have to read my mind  
You can see it when you close your eyes  
Don't believe it when you lose your faith  
Another moment is a moment away  
I can't tell you what the future holds  
Or how to live  
All I know is  
What feels right lights up my life again and again  
  
The only thing that our hearts are made of  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
The only thing real when push comes to shove  
Are the acts of forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end  
No one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love  
  
Let's jump the sun  
Let's find forever  
Where does the time go  
Just live your life  
You'll get another today today today  
Forgiveness and love  
'Cause in the end no one loses or wins  
The story begins again and again  
With forgiveness and love

Let's jump the sun  
Let's jump the sun

You know you really should believe in something  
Take a look at what you have  
To a dream that's not all that bad

Making the change is up to you  
You'll accept nothing less than the best

You can lead yourself away Understand You can have what you say

And I don't know how to stay  
I've got things that I must tell you  
That I don't know how to say

And talking don't come easy now

Behind these private eyes  
The truth would look so easy now  
But I'm running out of lies

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
""You've only one shot, get it right"", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun

Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,  
Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
Ooh you must believe me,  
I can feel your eyes go throught me,  
But I don't know why.  
  
Ooh I know you're going, but I can't believe  
It's the way that you're leaving,  
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,  
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to  
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
I can feel your eyes go throught me  
  
It seems I've spent too long  
Only thinking about myself - oh  
Now I want to spend my life Just caring bout somebody else.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,

Is laying shattered on the ground

And the eyes that used to burn for me  
Now they no longer look my way  
And the love that used to be  
Why, it just got lost in yesterday

Well there used to burn a flame

"People say that you're no good for me  
People say it constantly  
I hear it said so much I repeat it in my sleep  
  
Maybe I am just a fool for you  
Maybe you're no angel too  
But all that talk is cheap  
When I'm alone with you  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
Not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
All the world is crazy anyway  
What's it matter what they say  
If I'm the one that's wrong  
Then let in be my mistake  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
  
You wouldn't be with me tonight if I didn't feel I was right  
What will it matter anyhow a hundred years from now  
  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you  
Cause I can't see myself  
I'm not in love with you  
If love is blind  
I'll find my way with you

I should write a love song

You could use some variation""

I wanna be somebody's girl  
Would you show me the way?

"Hidden away - It's the end of a day  
And you're not really thinking at all  
There's that same stupid paper on the wall  
And a stain where the damp's crawling  
Chorus:  
He's still looking for his Shangri-la  
But he wouldn't know it . . .  
If it hit him in the face  
If it hit him in the face  
Day turns to daze  
And indifference plays  
While a sun goes on beating in the sky  
And a small child falls over as she crys  
Somewhere someone is calling her  
Chorus  
She's still looking for her Shangri-la  
But she wouldn't know it . . .  
If it hit her in the face  
If it hit her in the face  
Spoken : I take a look behind me  
And the sun shines brighter there  
And the people are much more beautiful  
In a place without a care  
And I'm wondering if there'll ever be room for me  
in Shangri-la  
Wondering now - do you love me - and now  
As I burn with a dangerous desire  
Is our time up and on to the next fire  
Got my fingers burnt and cut into the wire  
Do you think we will ever learn  
Chorus  
As we keep looking our Shangri-la...  
Our Shangri-la  
But we wouldn't know it . . .  
If it hit us in the face  
If it hit us in the face

He was knocked-out, knocked-out loaded  
And he was singin' this song to me

Servin' one year to ninety-nine

Let me tell you what I'd do

And plant a nice weed garden 'til the year 2002

I want water when I'm dry  
I want my lover when I'm lonely  
Give me a little heroin before I die  
Throw in a little cocaine before I die

Off the ground  
And I don't want  
To come down  
  
Is it me  
Or is everything spinning  
I'm wide awake  
But I must be dreaming  
It's like  
You're some kind of drug  
Try to catch my breath  
And see  
If I'm still breathing  
Touch my heart  
And make sure  
It's beating  
It's like  
I'm falling in love  
  
It's a rush  
I can't explain  
Like you shot  
Something crazy  
Into my veins  
And I'm ten feet  
Off the ground  
And I don't  
No I don't  
No  
Don't want  
To come down  
Don't want  
To come down  
Gonna come down

"I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme  
I've acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby  
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see  
There's no one more important to me  
So darling can't you please see through me  
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes  
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby  
We were alone and I was singin' my song,  
Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song  
Singin' my song

"Our generations  
Sees the world not the same as before  
We might as well just throw it all  
And live like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow  
  
We are the ones  
Who are living under the gun everyday  
You might be gone before you know  
So live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
  
Believe it  
The official view of the world has changed  
In a whole new way  
Live fast cause if you don't take it  
You'll never make it  
  
So if you understand me  
And if you feel the same  
Then you will know what nitro means  
You'll live like there's no tomorrow-ain't gonna waste this life  
There's no tomorrow-you ain't gonna live it for me  
There's no tomorrow

"I made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did  
Made a mistake, yes, I did, yes, I did  
Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
I've sent away the girl I love  
I said, I've sent away the girl I love  
She well gone, people crying  
  
Said, my bold heart been dying  
Who is it who made that mistake?  
Who is it who made that mistake?  
Oh, what a fool I've been tonight  
  
The girl I love is out of sight  
Now I'm so far from her, but it was me and my fate  
Who lost because of my mistake  
My trusting her has gone much too late  
  
Oh, what a fool I've been tonight

After all we have been through  
How can you stand there and deny it?  
And make a fool out of you

Like houses of cards

On splinters and glass

Wish I could fake it just like you

But spare your feet

Stand and deny it?

We have fallen from its grace  
We've got to face the situation  
Put things in their place

It's too much love  
And I just don't want to throw it away  
  
I've got to sacrifice my feelings  
To make you find your own  
I think it's time to end it  
You might be better off alone  
  
Oh, you're still the man  
You know just where you stand  
But the way you felt for me is gone  
There's no more truth to your song

believe it or not I wan't always this fucking cool  
I used to get a lot of shit when I was back in school  
But one day I turned the tables on all those assholes  
I filled em' all full of 9mm bullet holes  
Murder at the senior prom  
Mass murder at the senior prom x2  
I padlocked the gym doors the night of the senior prom  
Under the bleachers I planted several pipe bombs  
Stood up on the balcony sub-machine gun in my hand  
Said ""I'm your new prom king, does everybody understand?""  
Rounded up all the jocks who used to chase me home from school  
Tied their hands and feet and pushed them in the swimming pool  
Lined all the teachers who flunked me up against a wall  
Then one by one I stuck a butcher knife into them all  
Found that little fuck who got me busted for smokin' dope  
Now he's hanging from the flag pole kicking at the end of a rope  
Last but certainly not least when everybody else was dead  
I sodomized the cheerleaders and then I cut off all their heads

What you reading about, what you hold in your toes  
Is that a twig, are you a dove of peace

Are you a riddle to solve all along?  
Or am I over thinking thoughts of human after all

The seed is sown, all alone  
It grows above, with a heart of love  
Sharp and shelter of the animals of land and cold weather breathing  
We're all breathing in

Yes we are, only human  
If it's our only excuse do you think we'll keep on being only human  
Yes we are, only human, only human, so far, so far  
  
And this place it will outlive me  
Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree  
And I will have to give my thanks  
For giving me the branch to swing on  
If I ever fall in love  
I'll have to give myself a baby  
I will let my children have their way  
  
Cause we're only human, yes we are  
Only human, so far, so far

Growin' up, she's changin'  
She's so tough to try tame her

Plays the flirt, it's daddy's wake up

The years have passed  
Where did they run to  
Love still lasts the tears they've been through  
Time's a thief as precious moments fly by  
  
Dreamy eyes like her mama  
Her temper flies like her papa  
Her brother's cool and he's never been a bother  
But he's someone to turn to  
When life ain't feelin' right  
  
Hold on loosely but never let go  
The rest she'll have to find out on her own

"Unconditional, unconditional  
Unconditional, unconditional  
Who else would let someone nail them to a cross  
For the sake of others so they would not be lost  
No one, no one will go that far for us  
Who else would let someone get away with so much wrong  
But still extend them grace  
No one, no one have so much love for us  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional  
Who else but Him, He's a constant friend  
Even when others turn their backs against  
No one, oh no one is always there for us  
So what kind of love  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional  
So even when your closest friends and family give up on you  
There's not a day when you can't depend on Him  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional  
The kind of love He shows is unconditional  
His love don't come and go it's unconditional

"ONLY LOVE  
WRITERS MARK SPIRO, ROBBIE BUCHANAN  
I see the distant lights ahead  
Another hour or so, and I'll be back in bed  
I guess I really thought  
That I was gone for good  
But you know I never could  
I count the headlights passing by  
With every one I find  
Another reason why  
You'll be sound asleep  
And I'll look a fool  
How could I be so cruel?  
Only love could make me turn around  
And make these tears come tumbling down  
Only love  
Only love could make you stay with me  
I doubt myself but you believe  
Only love  
I wish that I could be that strong  
To see me as I am,  
And love me right or wrong  
I guess I'm still afraid  
To only say goodbye  
So I keep it all inside  
Only love...  
[Chorus]  
So I try to run, but no matter what I do  
I know it's true: I can't go on without you  
Only love...

Since I made up my mind  
Living in, live, live, live, live, live, live in memories  
Of a lone, lonesome time

It's useless to say  
So I just live my life

You've tried all you can

When His voice speaks through your doubt and brings healing

Even in your trial I will see you through

Repair your broken wings

"[Verse 1]  
I came down the mountain  
Draggin' our love affair  
Put on a pretty little number  
I'm wearing you still  
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast  
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me  
He has a funny way saying forever too fast  
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp  
For something he don't have  
I get on my knees and beg you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you  
Hear my sinner's prayer  
It's the only one I know  
It sure as hell don't rhyme  
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold  
[Verse 2]  
Got a baby sister who looks just like me  
She wants nothing more than a man to please  
Maybe she's in too deep  
Her love for him ain't cheap  
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece  
From Fulton Street  
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants  
He's thirsty when he drinks  
Gets on the brink, and throws her off  
I get on my knees and beg you

Hear my sinner's prayer  
I am what I am  
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man  
But you, but you

Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh

"Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love

Guess you want to be

Had enough of being close to you

Like you have never seen  
A mind so twisted  
With thoughts so unclean.  
My heart is racing  
All tattered and torn  
I stand here naked  
As the day I was born.  
  
Over and over I stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand  
I got to believe  
  
The sky is falling  
On this setting son  
Echoes of silence  
Ringing loud and long  
This isolation  
Is the king of pain  
A lost horizon  
In an ocean of flames  
  
Only the lonely will stand  
I'm holding the world in my hand

I've been here before,  
But not as I stand here today  
I wait for the dawn  
Ready to walk

"Shall I tell it again how we started as friends  
Who would run into one another now and again.  
At the Yippee Cai O or the Mesa Dupree, or a dozen different everyday places
to be.  
I was living alone, we were ever so brave on the telephone.  
Would you care to come down for fireworks time,  
We could each just reach, we step out of line.  
  
And the smell of the smoke and the lay of the land  
And the feeling of finding one's heart in one's hand  
And the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing ""love must stand,""  
Love forever and ever must stand.  
  
Unbelievable you, impossible me, the fool who fell out of the family tree,  
The fellow that found the philosopher's stone, deep underground like a
dinosaur bone.  
Who fell into you at a quarter to two with a tear in your eye for the Fourth
of July  
For the patriots and the minutemen and the things you believe they believed in
then  
  
Such as freedom, and freedom's land and the kingdom of God and the rights of
man  
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing ""love must stand,""  
Love forever and ever must stand and forever must stand.

Or it can be a paradox  
To seek solace in your solitude  
And when it feels

So whenever your need be  
Know that you can lean on me

When you're blinded by your doubt  
When you need someone to be there for you  
I'll help you find your way  
  
Don't keep your thoughts  
Locked behind your cellar door  
All shrouded in a mystery  
Just let them out  
That's what friends are for  
To give without giving the ""third degree""  
No need to be ashamed  
I've been through' it just the same  
So when your path misleads  
Know that you can call on me

This is stranger than I thought  
Six different ways inside my heart  
And every one I'll keep tonight  
Six different ways go deep inside  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give them more and more  
  
I'll tell them anything at all  
I know I'll give the world and more  
They think I'm on my hands and head  
This time they're much too slow  
  
Six sides to every lie I say  
It's that American voice again

And who will sum op the phrase for all left standing around in it

We'll walk it alone, stand up tall, then march to the fall  
So we better be happy now that we'll all go home.

Be so happy that you made it this far  
Go on be happy now. Please be happy now

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
With your feet up on the dashboard now  
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound

I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind,  
Just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head
tonight

The only place that I wanna be is where you are  
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far  
  
It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together  
All I really want is more than this moment right now  
'Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day,  
I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like you're waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go
down  
  
I swear it's like you're waiting on the sun to go down  
Waiting on the sun to go down

There's a hard moon risin' on the streets tonight  
There's a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
You're out on the town, safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes, looking for clues  
There's no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well you've been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend they're safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street, on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile, hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks you're asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
He's gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains, sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside

Want you to use me like you want to Lord  
But lemme carry a part of the load 'cause all I want is a piece of the road

But lemme carry a part of the load 'cause all I want is a piece of the road  
Well, I ain't too good but I ain't too bad

I've got to have a piece of the road before I reach the end of my run

Over glorious ocean, reflects the bright sky  
My heart it is aching, so much I could die  
I've known only the ocean, since I was a boy

And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to hide  
I fished with my father, so long long ago  
We were proud of our trade, and in us it did show  
We held our heads high, there was lots of fish then  
That was the time, when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster, we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled, we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people, will we ere be again?  
Chorus  
My father is gone now, and the fish are gone too.  
Abused and mis-managed, oh what can we do?  
I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,  
How will they know that we weren't the ones?  
Dfo regulations permitted the rape  
Of our beautiful ocean, from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers, they tore up our twine  
Politians don't care for what's yours or what's mine!  
Chorus  
You brave Newfoundlanders, now listen to me  
Shove the package to hell, go back to the sea  
If we don't stand our ground, we will fade away  
And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to die.

"I slipped into my jeans  
Lookin' hard and feelin' mean  
I took a spit at the moon  
It's all in this luney tune  
Just a little insane  
A couple shots, I can't feel no pain  
Hey, where have I been?  
And who are these scary men?  
  
Is this all real?  
Is this all necessary?  
Or it this a joke?  
  
Many know, I don't regret at all  
They locked me up for good  
Pinned me against the wall  
  
I can't find the exit  
I quit looking for doors  
I stole a razor from the commissary  
I just couldn't take it no more  
  
I'm swimmin' in blood  
Like a rat on a sewer floor  
No longer insane  
Just part of this crazy dream

"And it's over now  
The guns have flowed  
The nightmare flashed  
On a cradle road  
As the guilty rain came down  
No child to hold  
Through anxious fears  
No gentle hand  
To catch the tears  
That soak this ancient ground  
The smile that breaks so gently  
Belies a troubled head  
Like a voice that holds the secrets  
Of the life you might have led  
Eyes with pale indifference  
In danger and in grace  
But the glance that knows the death-knell  
Left it's shadow on your face  
In the deep enduring darkness  
As your loyal friends go down  
Touched by the violent crown  
'til their hunter's hunted down  
Chorus  
The web is slowly woven  
The endless dreamers shed,  
In the dawn the curfew is broken  
On the Sunday morning's dead.  
Centuries of thunder  
Take the castle in the flood  
To the cold night air of london  
Where you hands are bound in blood.  
Mid winter deepened  
As the parting turned inside  
A thousand times you cried  
But the shadow never died.  
And it's over now  
The guns have flowed  
The night mare flashed  
On a cradle road.  
As the guilty rain came down.  
No child to hold  
Through anxious fears  
No gentle hand  
No graceful years  
Just bitter ancient ground.  
But it's over now

To anyplace I know you like.

"In the night I'm calling you!  
Be my guide help me through!  
In the night I call your name  
You're the light in times of shame!  
The songs I sing  
All my love I bring for you!  
  
I always try to make things better  
Everything that has gone wrong  
Mighty plans in the right direction  
But very little has been done  
Everyday when I try to get forward  
I find myself another mile back  
Help me fighting!  
Help me breathing!  
Why am I falling down instead?  
  
Every useful minute seems to be the thought of you  
Every hour seems like wasted, filled with things that I might do  
Without love in my reactions seems the saddest thing, but's true!  
  
In the night  
Sometimes I cried after all I lied to you  
  
Free from ourselves and free from this world we may find  
The freedom we search  
'Cause all that we need is inside!  
The hours we waste we may not get back for a while  
And when it gets dark  
No chance will be there for a try  
  
When I wake up early in the morning  
I catch a book and jump inside  
I fill my head with a million wonders  
And try to fill the night with light  
The moment when I get things clearer  
I see another mountain to climb  
And always when I think I'm nearer  
I realize there is no time  
  
In the night  
This song I sing, all my love I bring for you!

The art of make-believe.  
The treasure behind closed doors.  
The hunter behind the trees  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.  
Dreaming.  
Dreaming of a woman in white.  
The sound from the street.  
The smell of sweet perfume.  
My breath inside of you hits an electric room  
Radiowaves thru the air.  
Can you hear me calling?  
Oh I've been dreaming.

Dreaming of a woman in white.

"Over time I've come to feel  
That everything must come apart it seems  
From the little child to the man of power  
From the beggar to the angel of my dreams  
From the thinnest thread we are sewn together  
From the finest string we dangle over time  
From the highest wire do we walk through fire  
Should our balance ever falter  
Should our steps be unaligned  
Such a big storm yeah such a strong wind blowing  
Such a loud voice calling for me to cross the line

But I'm not gonna give up the ghost  
No, not gonna give up the ghost  
I'm not gonna give up the ghost, no not gonna give it up  
'Cause I haven't the strength to hold out too long  
If we both hold on together we can make each other strong

After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh 'n' blood  
After all we're flesh  
  
Drop the mask take away the house  
And forget about the income and the car  
We're all the same underneath our shell  
We've all been to hell and we know what it's like  
And we've shared each other's sins  
We all know what it's like to give up the fight  
We've all been ashamed at one time or another  
We all have dreams and nightmares too  
  
When it all comes down we'll look out for each other  
(No one else will)  
But when I hear the call when I feel the thirst  
When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first  
  
Chorus  
  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
And every soul is tender to the touch  
We are made of stone, we are made of steel  
And we're all the same when we return to dust

When the catcher comes to take my soul  
He's gonna have to fight me first. ..

And even worked sometimes by moonlight when all of us kids were sound to
asleep  
Now I guess we were all just too busy fulfilling each one's worldly dreams  
To even care when they took the old chair along with all the other things  
You know if you could capture all the love that we found in that old chair  
  
Why you could wipe out all the hatred in this old world  
And you'd still have a lotta love to spare  
Now all I ask and it's not too much is just go with me down to the square  
And let's take a look among all the other things at mama's old rocking chair  
And look at all the teeth marks put there when we were small

The day will come when all power has been broken

Here on earth and out in space  
Forward on the road to glory

Eat be glad and drink the wine  
Leave your sadness by the river  
Giving love and given time

Along the lanes a lover takes  
Run with the fox

"Some guys fall in love with one girl, I gotta fall for two  
There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do  
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground  
Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town

I got double trouble, I got double trouble  
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah!  
  
I guess there's gotta be two dark clouds hanging over me

Every time I think that I have finally got it made  
Some losing cards are played, I just can't make the grade

"Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own,  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,  
You heard me saying a prayer for,  
Someone I really could care for,  
  
And then there suddenly appeared before me,  
The only one my arms will ever hold,  
I heard somebody whisper ""please adore me,""  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold,  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own.

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Fear not said the angel  
Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a savior  
Of the pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him  
From Satan's power and might  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeled down  
And to the Lord did pray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior

Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yea)  
Cause they only want to know you, enroll you  
Only for the things ya had

Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down  
See them try to mess to hurt you  
And work you  
Anything to bring ya down

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)  
You can't let them knock your hustle  
Not letting them know how much you struggle  
They turn green with envy when your on top  
And dem heart is full with strife  
Their by gonna try to take your life

Don't be fooled you betta recognize

A cross in Mexico  
And your kiss is like the innocence  
Of a prayer nailed to a door  
  
Oh surrender is much sweeter

Let the water wash our bodies clean  
And love wash our souls  
  
And pray that it's raining on Sunday

And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon  
And baby whatever comes Monday  
Can take care of itself

"Deep in the heart of the infinite darkness  
A tiny blue marble is spinning through space  
Born in the splendor of god's holy vision  
And sliding away like a tear down his face  
Closer you see the whole wide holy wonder  
Of oceans and mountains and rivers and trees  
And the strangest creation of many, the human  
A creature of laughter and freedom and dreams  
Now the warriors are waving their old rusty sabres  
The preachers are preaching the gospel of hate  
By their behaviour determined to teach us  
A lesson we're soon to be learning to late.  
Look closer my brother, we're killing each other  
And we'd better stop and get started today  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Yes, life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.

Foggy ways, november daze  
All the white wolves were smiling  
Cooper went out walkin' the clouds  
She left everything in a mess  
""Shut your mouth when you talk to me""  
Her words were always so small  
  
And there's a sound from the telephone  
When can I say she's coming home?  
Leave me the number you're dialing from  
And may I ask who's calling?  
May I ask who's calling?  
  
Cooper went out, 3 o'clock sharp  
I heard the bells from the church  
Someone said they saw a car  
Picking her up by the stations  
Cooper went out and that's all there is  
I'm just no one from next door  
Everything will be alright  
When all the flowers have cried

"There is a place on the mountain near by  
Deep in a cave but its up rather high  
There in the darkness I safely concealed  
All of the dreams that you never revealed  
  
And if you go there, and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there  
  
Such is the promise, such is the curse  
You could just live your life better or worse  
Knowing the casual dreams up on that hill  
Beckons and sways but won't bend to your will  
  
You might find a river under a mountain that  
Feeds a remote, subterranean fountain  
Drink from this taste just a hint of a dream  
That some how leads in to the underground stream  
  
And if you go there, and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime, devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open, you may find yourself there  
  
If you keep your heart open

To make the frolic complete

Sometimes he'd pick that ol' five-string  
Until the break of day  
  
So tune up the five-string  
Tighten up the hide  
Tell all the hill folks to get inside  
All them pickin' and a-sawing on the string

In a silent accord

And mesmerized as they light the flame  
Feel the new wind of change  
On the wings of the night  
  
No more turning away  
From the weak and the weary  
No more turning away  
From the coldness inside  
  
Just a world that we all must share  
It's not enough just to stand and stare  
Is it only a dream that there'll be  
No more turning away?

",On The Turning Away,Pink Floyd
"All around me  
This feeling has taken over me  
Thank God you feel it too  
'cause words would fail me  
And the spirits did bless this  
For getting on that road  
We were taken to a place  
Magical yet true  
As day becomes the night  
Love is in my life  
Nothing I have known  
Ever felt so right  
There's no more that I can do  
Than to fall a little more in love with you  
Here we are and we're paper dolls  
And we're side by side  
Here we are on the magic ride  
Just for you and I  
Everytime I look into your eyes  
I fall a little more in love  
Everytime takes me by surprise  
I fall a little more in love with you  
Do do do yeah  
Do do doo I fall a little more in love with you  
It's becoming the one thing  
That I want to last  
And there's never time enough  
The hours go too fast  
As day becomes the night  
Love is in my life  
Nothing I have known  
Ever felt so right  
There's no more that I can do  
Than to fall a little more in love with you  
Here we are and we're paper dolls  
And we're side by side

"Down into the dark I go, armed with just a candle and then my soul  
Cryptic messages written on the floor  
Rats are nibbling at my feet, I send one off to nevermore  
Too much darkness, spiders on my eyes  
  
Webs are hanging from my thighs, the fatter ones must die  
I see shadows walking straight and tall  
I don't know how they move, dancing on the walls  
Presence of fear, a presence so near  
  
I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I see a light, I push some bones aside  
  
Down into the dark I go, another chamber, a chamber with a glow  
Could this be a doorway to another world?  
Or darkness playing tricks, with my little mind?  
The virgin Mary is standing tall  
  
A full size figure carved in wood up against the wall  
Her face is peeling from all the years gone by  
Is it just a statue, or is it what I'm looking for?  
I break her face and see another one instead  
  
The mummy's face appears as the bandages they fall  
Dried out face with hate upon me gaze  
How grotesque... the mummy wears a crown of thorns  
From the empty sockets where its eyes should be  
  
An entity of light is pouring out towards me  
And then the sound... Jesus Christ,what have they done to you?  
I'm running for my life, I'm running from the night  
But it's so hard to breathe, the stench down here is much too much  
  
Satan help me, help me God  
Help me anyone, anyone who hears my cry of fear  
Cold winds from far beyond the dark  
Chasing through the catacomb and breathing down my neck  
  
Human bones... in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb, death over life... Catacomb, am I here to die?  
I know I'm here to die

"Heart sick at the sight of the

Spilled

"Free to turn like the wind on a summer day  
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon  
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still  
  
Or running from place to place in the heat of the day  
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
There beyond the horizon, there's another day  
Far above the pain and fear you feel  
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all  
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall  
  
There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one  
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
We all have our dreams, we all have our visions  
But time after time, we're faced with decisions  
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?  
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life  
  
Free in acres of sky on a summer day  
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart  
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life  
  
So just follow your heart and you'll see  
If you follow your heart you'll be free  
'Cause there's more to life, more to life

"Use a weapon of words  
  
Or a fight with your fists  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
Stand your ground and persist  
And be the last one to blink  
But can you forgive someone?  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will

When I was still ill  
See this mess and forgive someone  
  
And then recall if you can  
How all this even began  
Forgive someone  
  
And if you do I'll run to you  
Betray you with a word  
I would slit my own throat first of all I will

At track and field we dreamt of our beds  
In the bleachers you sit with your legs spread, smiling

Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed  
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need

It's the dream, afraid of waking, that never takes the chance  
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give  
And the soul, afraid of dyin', that never learns to live

And the road has been too long

"Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone and my dreams grow old  
There'll be no tears there'll be no regretting will she remember me will she
forget  
I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Someday I know she'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef  
I'll send a thousand flowers

"I move on like a sinner's prayer  
Letting go like a levee breaks  
Walk away as if I don't care  
Learn to shoulder my mistakes  
I'm built to fade like your favorite song  
I get reckless when there's no need  
Laugh as your stories ramble on  
Break my heart but it won't bleed  
My only friends are pirates, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I'm never sure when the truth won't do  
I'm pretty good on a lonely night  
I move on the way a storm blows through  
I never stay, but then again, I might  
I struggle sometimes to find the words  
Always sure until I doubt  
Walk a line until it blurs  
Build the walls too high to climb out  
I'm honest to a fault, it's just who I am  
I'm better as a memory than as your man  
  
I see you lean in, you're bound to fall  
I don't wanna be that mistake  
I'm just a dreamer, nothing more  
You should know it before it gets too late  
  
'Cause good-bye's are like a roulette wheel  
You never know where they're gonna land  
First you're spinning, then you're standing still  
Left holding a losing hand  
One day you're gonna find someone  
Right away, you'll know it's true  
That all of your seeking's done  
Was just a part of the passing through  
Right there in that moment  
You'll finally understand  
That I was better as a memory than as your man  
Better as a memory than as your man

"You breathe in me and I'm alive  
With the power of Your holiness  
You breathe in me and You revive  
Feelings in my soul that I've laid to rest  
  
So breathe in me, I need You, now  
I've never felt so dead within  
So breathe in me, maybe somehow  
You can breathe new life in me again  
  
I used to be so sensitive  
To the light that leads to where You are  
Now I've acquired these callouses  
With the darkness of a cold and jaded heart  
  
So breathe in me, I need You, now  
I've never felt so dead within  
So breathe in me, maybe somehow

Crushed my dreams and I don't mean maybe

"My heart had been broken and I couldn't take no more.

She did a number on my confidence, I was riddled with self doubt.

Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.  
  
'Round and 'round in a circle, it's always the same.  
One moment you swear you've had enough, the next you've got to know her name.  
All on my own, it wasn't that bad, I was getting by as I could get.  
I stopped into a drug store for one pack of cigarettes.  
She didn't have a quarter, had to call her cousin Kate  
and could I lend her maybe one thin dime?

Then took the wall

And the wrong time

And get to clear my name

Be the same

With her hair full of ribbons  
And green gloves on her hands  
So I asked this lovely creature  
Yes, I asked. yes I asked  
Would she walk with me a while  
Through this night so fast  
She took my hand, this lovely creature  
Yes, she said, yes, she said  
Yes, I'll walk with you a while  
It was a joyful man she led  
Over hills, this lovely creature  
Over mountains, over ranges  
By great pyramids and sphinxs  
We met drifters and strangers  
Oh the sands, my lovely creature  
And the mad, moaning winds  
At night the deserts writhed  
With diabolical things  
Through the night, through the night  
The wind lashed and it whipped me  
When I got home, my lovely creature

Papi know my face, so he don't expect it  
Runnin from the gutter so he gots to accept it  
Stripped his ass naked, then I put a slug in him  
He just another motherfucker, ain't no love in him  
I put a bug in him, never sleep on one who never slept  
I take my last breath every time I hit the meth  
It's the D to the E, M to the O N  
Blowin, steady playin shotgun, throwin  
Don't you see the shorty with the baseball cap  
Don't make me flip motherfucker with this baseball bat  
Best to brace yo' gat, 'fore I brace mine, cause I lace nine  
From yo' dome to yo' motherfuckin spine  
Chorus: Puff Daddy  
I be, that nigga that yo' niggaz can't fuck wit  
That nigga that yo' bitches wanna creep wit  
That nigga that you can't get along wit  
Playa hate but you wanna do a song wit  
That nigga that you see in the videos  
That nigga with the jewels and the jiggy hoes  
That nigga that'll die for his main man  
That nigga with the gettin money gameplan  
Verse Two: Jadakiss  
Haven't you heard that Bad Boys move in silence yet?  
When you increase the peace, the mo' wild it get  
I'm only sizin you niggaz from the waist up  
And I ain't, wettin no parts you can't touch with makeup  
Mr. Jacob without the Ladder  
It don't matter clap your wake up and do a shakeup  
Nobody badder, since the, baby Finster  
I was in the playpen wai-tin for kids to enter  
Shit I even blitz the rich to get chips  
Housekeeper disguised with the nine bubble grip  
Extra clip in the vacumn if I slip  
Room service ring the alarm and get the bomb  
Blown the hall pearl wide bill long gone  
Plus I got the power to ramshack, you dig that?  
Worldwide while you simply thought where you lived at  
Chorus  
Verse Three: Sheek  
You don't really wanna get involved, with the L-O-X car  
Tellers, Goodfellas, that's who we are  
You can't outsell us, it ain't shit you could tell us  
Jealous dog, cause we spread like relish  
Bad Boys, and we all eat together  
When it go down, then we draw heat together  
Since I made the connection with the big man  
I done got big plans, to be a little nigga in the big Land  
Ghetto star, presidential all gift wrapped  
And what you call weight, I know cats who sniff that  
Enjoy life, what are you sayin?  
If the DA ain't got a nigga payin, papi got him weighin  
Anything to do with money you can count J in  
Next time we bring it to these faggots we ain't playin

The truth is as simple as the air that we breathe  
So many souls with the need for human affirmation  
You and I choose to believe we are free!

So you hide them when you're able  
In the land of milk and honey  
You must put them on the table

As I touch the place you may as well have never been  
Love can hurt much more than one can bare  
When a heart beats for someone whose not there  
  
How many times must I tell myself that you're gone  
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong  
So wrong  
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call  
And lay pride aside  
If I had any sense left at all  
  
Voices call that only I can hear  
Who would have thought love was somethin' I would fear  
Almost hold, almost smell, almost taste  
On my mind, in my heart, on my face  
  
How many times must I tell myself that you're gone  
And when will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong

Can you still help somehow?  
I'm not a child, but my heart still can dream

And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
That right would always win  
And love would never end

He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn  
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn  
And they all looked very happy in the morning  
  
Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours  
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks  
When he'd had too many powers  
So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving  
And he took the road for god knows in the morning  
  
We walked him to the station in the rain  
We kissed him as we put him on the train  
And we sang him a song of times long gone  
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again

So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)

I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally Maclennane  
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn  
And ended up a barman in the morning  
  
I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down  
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown  
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away  
And some people left for heaven without warning  
  
We walked them to the station in the rain  
We kissed them as we put him on the train  
And we sang them a song of times long gone

He asked me all the details of the train that they went on  
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked  
And he took the road for heaven in the morning

Now he'll bum you for some whiskey  
And tell you how it was back in '52 when he played for Hank.  
  
And I'm watching the sun go down this evening  
And soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams.  
  
But before it does a new star will be shining  
And that's the way it is on the Nashville scene.  
  
From the outside its a castle,  
From the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means.  
  
And its a long, long way to the top  
And even further when you drop and I've been on both ends of the Nashville
scene.

"We're all so chic living in class A  
Partying and search sweet sorrow today

And neither do they  
We're all so amused  
And maybe it's better that way

He's been seen with her

But I bet we never will  
We're insecure, making me think  
I'm not fit to laze your dream  
I've seen you in my bayer  
You're a real player  
Taking it easy, taking it easy  
We all know we shouldn't  
And that is why we do it  
Here's smuggler's house  
Why don't you come and view it  
Sing my way of meaning

We all should know better  
But I bet we never will  
The sooner the better  
I'll send you a letter  
  
Hanging with your sister  
Playing naked twister  
Down to your joker  
Playing strip poker  
Give us a clue of  
Seeing the night thru  
And you're so kain

"I don't know how to play it,  
I don't know how to say it,  
But it's true,  
Oooooh I'm losing you.  
I only know that maybe,  
You and I have got to talk things trough,  
But baby before we do,  
I'm telling you.

You can go right on breaking my heart,  
I wouldn't care at all.  
You can go right on taking my love,  
I'll never close the door.  
And even thoughi know you don't  
Love me anymore,  
You can hurt me but you won't break down  
My love.  
I don't know what began it,  
It happens all the time,  
So I've been told,  
Love grows old and cold.  
Not for me the easy way,  
I love you then and now I love you still,  
And I guess I always will,  
Meanwhile....  
Repeat chorus  
Not for me the easy way,  
I don't want no trial seperation.  
I'd rather face the sleepless nights,  
Working on our love's salvation.

"Now everybody's got a crazy notion of their own  
Some like to mix up with a crowd, some like to be alone  
It's no one else's business as far as I can see  
But every time that I go out the people stare at me  
  
With my little ukulele in my hand, of course the people do not understand  
Some say why don't you be a scout, why don't you read a book?  
But I get lots more pleasure when I'm playing with my uke.  
  
Of course I take no notice you can tell  
For mother's sound advice will always stand.  
She said ""My boy do what I say and you'll never go astray  
If you keep your ukulele in your hand, yes son  
Keep your ukulele in your hand. ""  
  
While walking down the prom last night as peaceful as can be  
When some young girl said ""what about a stroll down by the sea?""  
She said her name was Jane and that she'd just come for the day.  
She looked so young and harmless that I couldn't turn away  
  
So with my little ukulele in my hand, I took a stroll with Jane along the
sand.  
We walked along for miles without a single care or frown  
But when we reached the sand hills she said ""Come on let's sit down.""  
I felt so shy and bashful sitting there, 'cause the things I said she didn't
understand  
She said ""Your love just turns me dizzy, come along big boy get busy""  
But I kept my ukulele in my hand, yes sir, I kept my ukulele in my hand.  
  
Made up my mind that I'd get wed some eighteen months ago.  
I also bought a book about the things you want to know.  
But just about a week ago I got a awful fright,  
I had to get dressed quickly in the middle of the night.  
  
And with my little ukulele in my hand, I ran along the road for Dr. Brand  
It didn't take him long to get his little bag of tools.  
I held his hat and coat and let him have my book of rules.  
Out of the bedroom door he looked and smiled  
  
He said, ""Come inside and see your wife and child.""  
My heart it jumped with joy, I could see it was a boy  
For he had a ukulele in his hand, oh baby  
He had a ukulele in his hand.

"I speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself  
So listen carefully to every word I say:  
""I'm the only one who's gonna get away with making excuses today,  
  
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have""  
Blackmailed myself  
Cause I ain't got anyone else  
""This is a stick up  
Give us all your inspiration""  
I've got the red carpet blues baby  
  
""Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound  
But don't get the wrong idea  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you  
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet  
That could change just how this goes  
No  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you""  
  
When I said that I'd return to you I meant more like a relapse  
Now again I think ""His and her's"" ""For better or worse""  
But the only ring I want buried with me are the ones around my eyes  
  
""You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have""  
I've got the red carpet blues baby  
  
""Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound  
But don't get the wrong idea  
We're gonna shoot you  
We're gonna shoot you  
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet

"You had something to hide  
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you  
Now you're not satisfied  
With what you're being put through  
  
It's just time to pay the price  
For not listening to advice  
And deciding in your youth  
On the policy of truth  
  
Things could be so different now  
It used to be so civilised  
You will always wonder how  
It could have been if you'd only lied  
  
It's too late to change events  
It's time to face the consequence  
For delivering the proof  
In the policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
  
Now you're standing there tongue tied  
You'd better learn your lesson well  
Hide what you have to hide  
And tell what you have to tell  
You'll see your problems multiplied  
If you continually decide  
To faithfully pursue  
The policy of truth  
  
Never again

"Here we are at the crossroads again  
And neither of us knows the right way

It wouldn't be the first time

Still burning me  
And I'm jealous of the sun that warms you  
And still I know  
I'm walkin' in your dreams  
And I ain't seen the last of you

That never really leaves

There's always another one to try  
So we're goin' through these changes

No good-bye  
  
Cause there's a part of you  
That never really leaves  
Over and over

And the mountains kissed the sky  
In the far beyond, with its many paths  
Man and nature lived side by side

But when we look  
Do we see with open minds?

Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Teach our children to look deeper than the surface  
See the world through another's eyes  
For to be blind beyond yourself  
Is to look but not see it  
Knowing much is not enough to be wise  
To see the wonder  
In all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
On the path that we choose  
Turn every corner  
Follow one, for another begins  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
See from all sides

"At times I don't believe that I can't control my heart  
It skips a beat even before the Lovin' starts  
I seem to fall in love  
With just the slighest touch  
And even the little things  
Begin to mean so much  
And though I should hold out longer  
Just to make sure things get stronger  
Chorus:  
You tell me that you love me  
And before I'm sure you really do  
You say you love me more and more each day  
And that's when my sensitivity gets in the way  
It's hard for me to play those fancy games of love  
Just say the right thing baby and it's automatic love  
I try not to let you know  
How easily I go  
Off into lovers' land  
Just when you touch my hand  
And though I should wait to see  
How things are gonna really be  
Repeat Chorus

You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky  
So I'm movin' on

Said hello to the southland, We're comin' to you  
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song  
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free

And keep rollin' on

I warned you twice, now you can settle the price

"I stood there beside myself,  
Thinking hard about the weather  
Then came by a friend of mine  
Suggested we go out together  
Then I knew it from the start:  
This friend of mine would fall apart  
Pretending not to see his gun,  
I said ""let's go out and have some fun""  
I know, you know, you believe in a land of love  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
I have always thought about  
Staying here and going out  
Tonight I should have stayed at home,  
Playing with my pleasure zone  
He has always been so strange,  
I'd often thought he was deranged  
Pretending not to see his gun,  
I said ""let's go out and have some fun""  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
When you are alone at night  
You search yourself for all the things  
That you believe are right  
If you give it all away  
You throw away your only chance to be here today  
Then a fight breaks out on your street  
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat

Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death

She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
  
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
  
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
  
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear  
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries on my bones

Extinguishing the fires in a private hell  
Provoking the heartache to renew the licence  
Of a bleeding heart poet in a fragile capsule  
Propping up the crust of the glitter conscience  
Wrapped in the christening shawl of a hangover  
Baptised in the tears from the real  
Drowning in the liquid seize on the Piccadilly line, rat race  
Scuttling through the damp electric labyrinth  
Caress Ophelia's hand with breathstroke ambition  
An albatross in the marrytime tradition  
Sheathed within the Walkman wear the halo of distortion

She turned the harpoon and it pierced my heart

He'll fade with old soldiers in the grease stained roll call  
And linger with the heartburn of Good Friday's last supper  
Son watches father scan obituary columns in search of absent school friends  
While his generation digests high fibre ignorance  
Cowering behind curtains and the taped up painted windows  
Decriminalised genocide, provided door to door Belsens  
Pandora's box of holocausts gracefully cruising satellite infested heavens

Radioactive perfumes, for the fashionably, for the terminally insane, insane

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.

He was made of snow but the children  
Know how he came to life one day.  
There must have been some magic in that

For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.

So he said, ""Let's run and  
We'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away.""  
Down to the village,  
With a broomstick in his hand,  
Running here and there all  
Around the square saying,  
Catch me if you can.

Right to the traffic cop.  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler ""Stop!""

"Like a stone you watch it fall  
And let it roll out over the fields  
You take your time and watch it crawl  
Like you're the big shot symphony  
But oh what would you say if I told you 'the pitch is wrong' with a smile?  
I took a trip to wonderland gonna get you nowhere by a mile  
  
I, I could light it up for you  
I, I could light it up for you  
We, we ain't got a shot to lose  
Put it on but fade it out tell you that you weren't enough  
Acting like your favorite drug, raise a cup  
We can light it up,  
We can light it up  
  
I took a shot and missed the mark  
Well every single day I multiply  
A million drums of kerosene  
Baby, like a hotel in the sky  
I just want to see all the sparks you're trying to hide  
Let's take a trip to wonderland, we can just tune this fire tonight  
  
I, I could light it up for you  
I, I could light it up for you

Wondering what you would say  
Hoping you'd understand  
It's not a role I usually play  
Don't speak too much of what's been going on

But you opened your heart to me  
Underneath all you feel you know  
How deep our love could be  
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go  
Then I'm leaving it up to you  
Even a fool would know that I'm not through

"He said he'd try just a little bit  
He didn't want to end up like them  
And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder  
Pounding on the door to make the next score  
  
Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it  
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul  
  
Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell  
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell  
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies  
His cause of death, high speed on burnt ice  
  
Always looking at the ground, a broken, beaten man  
Memories of his family are calling after him  
He can hardly thing, hardly walk  
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk  
With just one hit the pain would go away  
But he's dead if he does  
  
Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes  
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia grows

'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade

I'll weave my spell""

Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say ?""  
""Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray  
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday  
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air  
I'll say farewell""

They would not leave a number, but I know the place to call,  
Cause my uncle took a message, and he wrote it on the wall.  
  
Long Distance Information, get in touch with my Marie.  
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee.  
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge,  
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge.

Only that I miss her and all the fun we had.  
But we were torn apart because her Mom did not agree,  
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Now, last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye,  
With ""hurry home"" drops on her cheeks that trickled from her eyes.  
Marie is only 6 years old. Information, please,  
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Yes, oh, yes, Long Distance, I'll accept the charge. I'll pay.  
But which loved one is calling me? I did not hear you say.  
Both are deep within my heart, her Mom and my Marie.  
It's so good to hear your voice from Memphis, Tennessee.  
  
Oh, you mean so much to me, more than you'll ever know.  
Surely you have not forgot how much I love you so.  
If you would remember, dear, and sometimes talk to me.  
Maybe that would reunite our home in Tennessee.  
  
Last time I saw you, just before I had to leave.  
You didn't want to see me off, and promised not to grieve.  
My heart was torn apart, as I looked back at Marie.  
And there the pieces still remain with you in Tennessee.  
  
I Guess I should stop talking, after all, you placed the call.  
But any way that I can help. you know I'll help you all.

"I didn't wanna say I'm sorry  
For breaking us apart  
I didn't wanna say It was my fault  
Even though I knew it was  
  
I didn't wanna call you back  
Cause I knew that I was wrong  
Yeah, I knew I was wrong

One in the same  
Never to change  
Our love was beautiful  
We got it all  
Destined to fall  
Our love was tragical  
Wanted to call  
No need to fight  
You know I wouldn't lie  
But tonight  
We'll leave it on the line  
  
Listen baby,  
  
Never would've said forever  
If we knew it ends so fast  
Why did you say I love you  
If you knew that it wouldn't last?  
  
Baby, I just can't hear what you're saying  
The line is breaking up  
Or is that just us?  
Or is that just us?

"I was walking by the graveyard, late last Friday night,  
I heard somebody yelling, it sounded like a fight.  
It was just a drunken hobo dancing circles in the night,  
Pouring whiskey on the headstones in the blue moonlight.  
So often have I wondered where these homeless brothers go,  
Down in some hidden valley were their sorrows cannot show,  
Where the police cannot find them, where the wanted men can go.  
There's freedom when your walking, even though you're walking slow.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
It's hard to be a pack rat, it's hard to be a 'bo,  
But living's so much harder where the heartless people go.  
Somewhere the dogs are barking and the children seem to know  
That Jesus on the highway was a lost hobo.  
And they hear the holy silence of the temples in the hill,  
And they see the ragged tatters as another kind of thrill.  
And they envy him the sunshine and they pity him the chill,  
And they're sad to do their living for some other kind of thrill.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brother is my friend.  
  
Somewhere there was a woman, somewhere there was a child,  
Somewhere there was a cottage where the marigolds grew wild.  
But some where's just like nowhere when you leave it for a while,  
You'll find the broken-hearted when you're travelling jungle-style.  
Down the bowels of a broken land where numbers live like men,  
Where those who keep their senses have them taken back again,  
Where the night stick cracks with crazy rage, where madmen don't  
Pretend,  
Where wealth has no beginning and poverty no end.  
  
Smash your bottle on a gravestone and live while you can,  
That homeless brothe

"For the first time in my life I'm up to run away

"Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,  
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,  
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,  
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,  
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it  
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,  
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.  
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,  
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,  
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,  
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,  
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,  
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,  
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive  
Peace of mind's so hard to find.

What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now  
  
Problems, complications and accusations  
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces  
A war is taking place.  
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace  
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.  
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions  
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,

And restoring life to the lighthouse  
A slow motion wave on the ocean stirs  
My emotion up like a rain cloud  
  
When did the sky turn black?  
And when will the light come back?  
  
A cab driver, turned to sky diver  
Then to survivor, dying to break down  
A blood brother, surrogate mother  
Huggin' each other, cryin' their eyes out

Locked in the attic strung out and spellbound

This must be a bad trip.  
All of the other pills, they were different,  
Maybe I should get some help.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I can't stay on your life support,  
There's a shortage in the switch,  
I can't stay on your morphine,  
'Cause it's making me itch.  
I said I tried to call the nurse again,  
But shes being a little bitch,  
I think I'll get outta here, where I can...

Run just as fast as I can,  
To the middle of nowhere,  
To the middle of my frustrated fears.  
And I swear you're just like a pill,  
Instead of makin' me better,  
You keep makin' me ill,  
You keep makin' me ill!  
Run just as fast as I can,  
To the middle of nowhere,  
To the middle of my frustrated fears.  
And I swear you're just like a pill,

"Driving fast and ditching school, breaking all the precious rules.  
It's too hard, to make a living.  
I need a kick, I need a girl so badly I could scream.  
I'm sick of watching people on T.V.  
  
I feel the wind, in my face  
I need a car at the start of the race  
I need a highway and a beer  
If I don't stop now there's plenty to fear

Just how dangerous I am.

I need something I can taste  
And a vacation from the human race

If I get mad I do such terrible things  
I get real crazy and I make girls scream.

"It's not unusual to be love by anyone  
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone  
When I see you hanging about with anyone  
It's not unusual to see me cry  
I want to die  
  
It's not unusual to go out at anytime  
When I see you out and about it's such a crime  
If you should ever want to be love by anyone  
It's not unusual it happens every day  
No matter what you say  
You'll find it's happens all the time  
Love will never do whatcha you want it to  
Why can't this crazy love be mine

"We all come in from the cold  
We come down from the wire  
An everybody warms themselves  
To a different fire  
When sometimes we get burned  
You'd think sometime we'd learn  
The one you love is the one  
That should take you higher  
You ain't got no one  
You better go back out and find her  
  
Just like children hidin' in a closet  
Can't tell what's goin' on outside  
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track  
We'll get taken for a ride  
By a parlor trick or some words of wit  
A hidden hand up a sleeve  
To think the one you love  
Could hurt you now  
Is a little hard to believe  
But everybody darlin' sometimes  
Bites the hand that feeds  
  
When I look around  
Everybody always brings me down  
Well is it them or me  
Well I just can't see  
But there ain't no peace to found  
But if someone really cared  
Well they'd take the time to spare  
A moment to try and understand  
Another one's despair  
Remember in this game we call life  
That no one said it's fair

I think of it as home  
When there ain't enough of me  
To go around  
I'd rather be left alone  
But if I call you out of habit  
I'm out of love and I gotta have it  
Would you give it to me  
If I fit you needs  
Like when we both knew we had it  
But now the damage's done  
And we're back out on the run  
Fun how ev'rything was roses  
When we held on to the guns  
Just because you're winnin'

"Every other Friday  
It's toys and clothes in backpacks  
Is everybody in okay?  
Let's go see dad  
Same time in the same spot  
Corner of the same old parking lot  
Half the hugs and kisses there are always sad  
We trade a couple words and looks  
And kids again

I pick up the love we made in both my arms  
It's movies on the sofa

There's so much not to do and all day not do it in

While my children hug their mother in the parking lot  
We don't touch, we don't talk much

As she drives away with every piece of heart I've got  
I re-convince myself we did the right thing

Stone by stone, I will always be with you  
  
Without clothes, without shoes, you watch me at my work  
With feet in cement you improve the appearance of the foundation  
There will be a garden outside and nobody hears you screaming  
  
Stone by stone, I build you in  
Stone by stone, I will always be with you

All nails stand to attention if I put them in your body, wood ramming

"[Verse:]  
I ain't a gangsta, that's just my image  
I ain't a thug either nigga, I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you, listen to me  
I'm trying to tell you what's real, I don't live my life dangerously  
Live how I live, live by my rules  
You wouldn't survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug, and talk like a gangsta  
But that don't mean I'm gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich, I'm stay with my crew  
I'ma stay with my peeps, I'ma stay in the streets  
I'ma keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now I'm not saying this to build my fan base  
And I don't give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And I'ma stay true to myself, I'm a man  
I'm a real nigga, hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock, I'm just Cris from the block  
Ya I'm that same troublemaking kid from the block (whut)  
[Verse 2:]  
I went from boy to man, ain't nobody gonn' stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man, from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man, from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man, from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And there's Haze selling crack overseas,  
P. Diddy himself can't get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats  
Holla Back nigga, who else is fucking with that

"I wasn't fooling around  
Everything's true that I said  
So take me seriously  
Darling, please just take me  
I wasn't fooling around  
  
Laugh if you want to  
But I wasn't joking  
About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel  
  
I wasn't playing around  
I'm not a kid anymore  
I'm not the clown  
That's just here to amuse you  
I wasn't fooling around

"I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then like my dreams they fade and die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
They f-f-fly so high, nearly reach the sky  
Then in my d-d-dreams they fade and d-d-die  
  
Fortune's always hiding  
I've looked everywhere  
I'm f-f-forever be-be-blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles in the air  
  
I'm forever blowing bubbles  
Pretty bubbles, no more troubles  
Pretty bubbles in the air

"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

",Ballad In Plain D,Bob Dylan
"Well, they keep on taking my heart  
And they keep on taking my soul  
They keep taking an inch when I give them a mile  
And now it seems it's been a while since anyone smiled  
They don't know me  
They don't know me  
But my name is on the highway sign, never look behind  
All those troubles are gone, nothing left but to run  
So meet me down and don't be shy  
A place where we can hide  
There ain't nothing to fear  
There ain't no-one back here  
But you and I and these cloudy skies  
So it's time to leave our home  
And see the faces we've out-grown  
Through the years we've kept our backs to the wind  
So long, farewell, good-bye my friend

"Patience, shadow. While you're sick, there's no sight to see.  
Little shadow, little shadow.  
To the night, will you follow me?  
Pardon, shadow, hold on tight to your darkened key.  
Little shadow, little shadow.  
To the night, will you follow me?  
  
Closer, shadow, volume strikes, still we're cut free  
of this song, little shadow  
To the night, will you follow me?  
Hey, shadow, stars, break of dawn, take a turn for stars, to my fantasy  
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?  
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?

"Let us put men and women together, see which one is smarter,  
Some say men, but I say no, women got the men like a puppet show.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,  
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way,  
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right.  
  
Little boy sitting in the corner and cry, big man come and ask him why,  
He said ""I can't do what the big boys do"", the man sat down and he cried too.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,  
I say, it's the women today, smarter than the men in every way.  
That's right the women are smarter, the women are smarted that's right  
  
Ever since the world began women been imitating the ways of men,  
But listen cause I've got a plan, give it up just don't try to understand.  
  
It ain't me it's the people that say, men are leading women astray,

And heres my song  
And heres my song

And I was born in the boredom and the chowder

I left my home in the maritimes  
And I, I headed down the turnpike  
For new england  
Sweet new england  
  
Had holes in my confidence  
And holes in the knees of my jeans  
And I was left without a penny in my pocket  
And ew-whee I was desitute as a girl could be  
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
Id surely hock it  
  
I met a young girl in the parking lot  
She was preaching to the crowd  
By singing sacred songs and reading from the bible  
Well I told her I was lost  
And she told me all about the penticost  
And I seen that girl as a road to my survival  
  
Later on the very same night  
She crept to my tent with a flashlight  
And these long years of innocence ended  
Took me to the woods  
I said her comes something that feels so good  
And just like a dog I was befriended  
I was befriended  
  
I said what a night  
What a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers  
I was lying under the stars just playing my guitar  
But I was thanking the lord for my fingers  
For my fingers

"I was running late again, picking up a few things  
And there you were on isle 13.  
I felt that old rush, when you saw me you blushed  
Like you did when you were sweet sixteen.  
They said you looked lost on the dance floor,  
With a lonely look in your eyes.  
Don't know why I didn't show, to this day I still don't know  
For once I wish I hadn't thought twice.  
Then your folks split up and you moved to Colorado,  
And I headed out to Tennessee.  
Heard you got married and you moved back home,  
Here we are again, you and me.  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.  
Annie, I owe you a dance.  
  
Don't the years fly by in the blink of an eye,  
Yeah loves, I've had a few.  
I've been a million places and I've seen a million faces,  
But I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you.  
Remember how we'd talk for hours, keeping each other's secrets,  
Made a promise I'd take you to homecoming,  
But Annie I didn't keep it.  
Almost called you up, when I played it bolder,  
But I thought I'd just let it be.  
Heard you found yourself a real good man,  
Do you ever think of you and me?  
  
It's no surprise the light in your little girl's eyes,  
Shines like the ring on your hand.  
Annie, I owe you a dance.  
  
So put your groceries in the basket, I'm so sorry, now I'm asking  
Like I should have twenty years ago.  
And I know it's all over, I'm just looking for some closure,  
And there's a song on the radio.  
You give me your hand and we start to dance,  
The cashier gives us a smile.  
As you turn and walk away, I hear your little girl say  
""Momma, who was that guy?""  
I shouldn't be surprised, look forgiveness in your eyes,  
Gave me a second chance.  
Annie, thanks for the dance.

This is your calling.  
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do  
Something has grown in my chest.  
And I have seen it.  
It is hard and cold.  
It's been dormant for many years.  
I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you  
But this is what you deserve  
This is whta we deserve  
This is something that we have brought upon ourselves

We are not a victim, you are not a victim

Well I may not be high society but I got all I need  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me  
  
Well I got me a wife and we're bringing up a young one  
Well she's a backwoods woman and my boy he's a top gun  
We live out in the country where we're free to roam  
And when a hard day is over how I love just going home  
Well it's the life I live and the air I breathe  
  
The way I believe  
  
And that's just me  
The only way I know to be  
That's just me  
What you get is what you see  
  
Well they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed

But that's just me  
  
Yeah they tell me I'm old fashioned  
And that I'm part of a dying breed  
I'd say I'm living in real good company  
But that's just me

"Once I had a heart cold as ice  
And love to me was only for fun  
And I made a mark for each broken heart  
Like nuches on the but of a gun  
  
Once I had a track on my sleeve  
And a reputation all over town  
I was heartless and cold and wherever I go  
I shut down every young girl I found  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
Who thought that someone like you  
Would take a desperado like me  
But all here I am, I'm week as a lamb  
With my bleading heart there at your feet  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love  
  
And I used to be a moonlight-bandit  
I used to be heartbreaker-kid  
But then I met you and the next thing I knew that I was  
Oh, shut full of love

I was alone and I needed a hand  
I was going down  
But someone rescued me

My God cares too much to say  
His mercies are new everyday  
I get down to pray  
And then help is on its way

If things go wrong, it'll be alright  
'Cause someone greater  
Is watching over me

"Out of the ruins  
Out from the wreckage  
Can't make the same mistake this time  
We are the children  
The last generation  
We are the ones they left behind  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it  
Living under the fear till nothing else remains  
  
We don't need another hero  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome  
  
Looking for something we can rely on  
There's got to be something better out there  
Love and compassion, their day is coming  
All else are castles built in the air  
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it  
Living under the fear till nothing else remains  
All the children say  
  
We don't need another hero  
We don't need to know the way home  
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome

We leave only a mark  
Will our story shine like a life  
Or end in the dark  
Give it all or nothing

"Oh where are you now?  
Pussy willow that smiled on my sleeve  
When I was alone, you promised a stone from your heart  
My head kissed the ground,  
I was half the way down, treading the sand  
Please...please lift a hand, I'm only a person  
Whose armbands beat on his hands hang tall  
Won't you miss me? Why don't you miss me at all?  
My head touched the ground, I was half the way down  
Strumming the sand  
Please lift a hand, I'm only a person  
With Eskimo chain, you tattered my brain all the way  
Won't you miss me? Why don't you miss me at all?

"Ain't it funny how time  
Steals the feelings from a love affair  
And there's no place to lay the blame  
It ain't a case of no one cares  
Helplessly just watch it fade away  
Neither will admit it, we're both aching to say  
  
Ooh, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you weren't so sure of me  
I had my little jealousies  
Ooh, bring back the days when we were crazy in love  
I need to feel that way again  
Remember when we were crazy in love  
  
Oh, it used to be so easy  
One touch and you were high  
And I could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes  
Baby ain't there anything we can do  
'Cause I know you're missing me  
As much as I've been missing you  
  
Ooh, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you weren't so sure of me  
I had my little jealousies  
Ooh, bring back the days when we were crazy in love

"Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill  
Break your heart and make you love her still  
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill  
  
Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne  
Make you feel so damn alone  
Leave you begging baby come back home  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun  
When your wings melt and you come undone  
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one  
  
She steals your heart just like a thief  
Makes you lay roses at your feet  
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
You thank God you found her  
can't live your life without her  
And every little thing about her is all you need  
All you need  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know, only a woman

Lyrics by bernie taupin  
Released as a uk b-side in november, 1973  
  
Sitting here on christmas eve with a brandy in my hand  
Oh i've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand  
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace  
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race  
  
And i keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise  
The bearded weirdy's just arrived  
  
  
Ho ho ho, guess who's here  
Your fat and jolly friend draws near  
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise  
The bearded wierdy's just arrived  
  
  
On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head  
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red  
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue  
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room

"Answers never clear again  
This turning of the page  
This turning look away  
  
There I took a left turn  
Before I came of age  
I agreed to let it out  
I agreed to let it go  
I agreed to turn around  
I agreed to turn my face away  
  
Danger is the most important  
Fear you'll ever know  
The transporting of refugees  
The silent night is cold  
  
And all the time  
We looked around  
As we were never told  
  
But we agreed to let it out  
We agreed to let it go  
We agreed to turn our backs  
We agreed to turn our face away, away  
  
Thousands to the million  
Sisters, grandmothers and more  
It's not the feast we throw away  
It's the way we close the door  
  
Their silence deafens every sound  
We try just to ignore  
To waste their future freedom  
We'll regret forever more  
  
I believe in  
I believe in  
These are the days that we will talk about  
I believe in  
I believe in  
One understanding what is real  
  
If we are one  
Then we are refugees  
We are the prisoners of our own design  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
If we are one  
Seen through the eyes of a child  
We will perpetuate this song  
Perpetuate this song of love  
  
Now we build the bridges  
That we walk upon together  
At the last count many lonely souls  
The sadness always kills  
  
Each breaking point is waiting  
For the promise to fulfill  
  
When we agree to turn the page  
When we agree to help them free  
When we agree to let it out  
When we agree to let it shine  
When we agree to let it run  
When we agree to let it change our lives  
  
I believe in, our lives  
I believe in, our lives  
These are the days we will talk about  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love  
  
When we are one  
Seen through the eyes of child  
We will perpetuate this song of love

Lies

Surprise  
For how were they to know that here the ground was soaked  
In red  
Or that we could fill the valley with our dead.

To pack our bags and head on home to bring the new year  
In  
While all around me boys who help me sow last season's  
Crop  
By charging at the cannons till they drop  
  
I told my mother not to write cause we're always moving  
  
On  
I told my brother not to join cause he'd only fight me  
Gun  
But if we keep on much further retreating all the way  
Oh we'd all be going home just any day.

Left my bicycle under the stairs  
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs  
Made my way across the crowded room

So turning on a friendly grin  
Stood on the table with my glass of gin

Was escorted by a friendly slag

Wandered up across to the door  
Missed my step and I fell on the floor  
Said one word and I was asked to leave  
Kinda' wish I was dead

And I'll be so sad to leave  
So while I was here  
I'll had me a real good time

And I just can't face the day  
When darkness falls around me  
And I just can't find my way  
When my eyes don't clearly see  
And I stumble through it all  
You I lean upon  
You keep my strong  
And you rise me when I fall

You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
  
When life brings me to my knees  
When my back's against the wall  
You are standing there right with me  
  
Just to keep me standing tall  
Though a burden I may be  
You don't weary  
You don't rest  
You are reaching out to carry me  
And I know I'm Heaven-blessed

Should he fall, he will always get up again  
And if he's hurt he never shows it  
If he's wrong nobody knows it

"In a world lit only by fire  
Long train of flares under piercing stars  
I stand watching the steamliners roll by  
  
The caravan thunders onward  
To the distant dream of the city  
The caravan carries me onward  
On my way at last  
On my way at last  
  
I can't stop thinking big  
I can't stop thinking big  
  
On a road lit only by fire  
Going where I want, instead of where I should

Carried through the night into the city  
Where a young man has a chance of making good  
A chance to break from the past

Like time they go on and on  
I guess could learn to do the same

Tell myself it was meant to be this way  
No matter how I try

There's no need to be denied  
Chew before swallowing pride  
I want to live so let me die

Cooking her breakfast alone  
She quietly dresses  
And pulls up the shade  
And sits in the chair by the phone  
  
But nobody ever comes by anymore  
Nobody ever calls  
Most days she sits and just stares  
At the windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
Children all married  
Husband's passed on  
Nothing but time on her hands  
Most of her mornings  
Are spent in her dreams  
Or making her sad little plans  
  
Maybe she'll go to the corner today  
And pick up the new McCall's  
If just to escape for an hour  
From her windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
  
The clock on the mantel  
Chiming the hours  
Must be the loneliest sound  
She washes her dishes  
And waters her flowers  
And afterwards has to sit down  
  
Sometimes she still  
Can remember a child  
Playing with china dolls  
Now all that she's left  
Are these memories  
And windows and walls  
Windows and walls  
Windows and walls

Girl, on the edge flippin' off the lamp  
There'll be an end darling to your endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face  
And you'll be looking for another pretty place  
Baby, this side of the street.  
  
Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl  
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true  
Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do?  
  
Well, you and your poetry and your boku world  
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, you've got the look as if you owe the world  
Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn  
On the wrong side of the street.  
  
Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you  
Go out looking for some strange new games  
Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore.  
  
All right now... (guitar break)  
  
I know the danger that your desire brings  
And I know the strangeness that you'll find  
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me.  
Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps  
There'll be an end darling to this endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
  
Yea, and everyday well it just brings the same  
You started looking for some very strange new games  
On the wrong side of the street.  
Well, you and your desires lead to confusion  
Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions  
And see, open your eyes and see, girl.  
  
All right...

She said there was nothing that I could have done  
There was nothing nobody could say  
Me and you weve known each other ever since we were sixteen  
I wished I would have known I wished I could have called you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes  
We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things wed ever  
Seen  
Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you  
Just to say goodbye bobby jean  
  
Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid  
Now there aint nobody nowhere nohow gonna ever understand me the way you did  
Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere  
In some bus or train traveling along  
In some motel room therell be a radio playing  
And you'll hear me sing this song  
Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between  
And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind  
But just to say I miss you baby, good luck goodbye, bobby jean

Tell him I feel so bad  
For messing up what we had  
And if you see him  
Tell him I'm sorry

And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride

Tell him I'm begging

Just for a second chance  
And if you see him  
Tell him just how I look

The make up don't seem to hide  
And I stay awake every night  
And I pray that he just might walk in  
And love me  
Walk in and love me

Tell him he was  
My everything  
He was more than just a flame  
And I need him

And if you see him  
Tell him my fire  
No, it's just won't burn  
Till the day that he returns  
And I want to be by his side  
And I need his love and pride

"Each day I live  
I want to be  
A day to give  
The best of me  
I'm only one  
But not alone

Is yet unknown

Fought every gain  
To taste the sweet  
I face the pain  
I rise and fall  
Yet through it all  
This much remains

When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny  
Then in that one moment of time  
I will feel  
I will feel eternity  
  
I've lived to be  
The very best  
I want it all  
No time for less  
I've laid the plans  
Now lay the chance  
Here in my hands  
  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny  
Then in that one moment of time  
I will feel  
I will feel eternity  
  
You're a winner for a lifetime  
If you seize that one moment in time  
Make it shine  
  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny

I will be  
I will be free

"Warm and lovely mystery,  
Fire smiling through  
Before this moment fades away  
I want to know you  
I've got lightening in my pocket,  
Thunder in my shoe  
Have no fear I've got something here  
I want to show you  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
It's a low road, a high wire  
Going from me to you  
And in your eyes  
The distance left is closing  
I've got a feeling in my oceans  
Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields  
This prison is opening  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
Our shadows wake each day  
Though they don't know why  
They hope and try -- live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery,  
Can you hear the choir?  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Abandon your sad history  
And meet me in the fire  
Our angels wait  
To take us higher and higher  
Higher and higher  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you

"Oh Mary was unhappy with the life that she led  
She was a simple girl without much to say  
So one day she upped and left her dreary home  
And she left all her friends to wander all alone  
And at first she was afraid, she was so far away  
From her home but slowly she got to like it anyway  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
Well in time she found  
That mountain that she had been taught  
Her whole life, that she must avoid  
And though at first it hurt, and no one could comfort her  
She finally came to appreciate it  
And she liked it, she liked it--oh wasn't she surprised  
And though still alone, she grew so much inside  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
  
And after a time, she became so sublime  
She could look in people's eyes and read their minds  
Though her hands would sometimes bleed and occasionally  
She would long for her past and the memories they bring  
She decided to return to her old home town  
And her heart was burning with all the things she found  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
  
So Mary came back and at first no one recognized her face  
And her friends were all a little bit afraid  
When they heard what she had to say  
They all slowly backed away  
And her family took her aside and put their arms around her  
They said:  
Mary, won't you please come back to us now  
There is still time to repent for all your sins  
And Mary started to cry when she realized  
That she'd never come home again in her life  
  
Oh Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Mary won't you please come  
Please come home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, home  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Come home, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah....

It was laughin' it was dancin'  
I was cigarettes and bourbon flavored kisses  
It was alligator shoes and new blue suits  
And anything that money wishes  
It was sittin' up all night and waitin'  
For the dawn to bring another wondrous day  
It was holding hands and thinking  
That tomorrow is a million years away  
  
Back when we were young everybody came to see us  
Everybody wanted to be us back when we were young  
We loved each other so all our friends told one another  
And we even told each other back when we were young  
  
It was rolling seventh of a time  
And thinking it was never ever gonna end  
Back then we even thought of time itself  
As being something as a passing friend  
It was buyin' one another things we didn't need  
And birthdays were so corny  
Back then we even had some friends  
Live as far away as California  
Back when we were young

"He bought two-fifths of lead free gasoline  
Said, the bottle is dusty, but my engine is clean  
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find  
If his bride didn't like it, St Peter wouldn't mind  
  
Now I lie here so out-of-breath  
And over-opiated  
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no but  
Maybe he could have waited

Addicted to approval, addicted to the air

"When I sleep  
I have dreams about the way we used to kiss  
About the way you used to hold me  
And say nothin' would ever harm me  
When we first met  
Oh how you charmed me  
Made me smile when I was down  
Big pimpin' around the town  
You and me  
Whenever they'd see you  
They'd see me  
A lover and a friend to me you were  
How did it end  
How it hurts  
To not have you in my life  
when I won't even be alright

You never know what you have  
Till its gone  
Treated you wrong  
For so long  
Now you're gone away  
But the love still is here

Still  
I still got love for you  
Still  
After what we been through  
Still  
I gave my heart to you  
And baby you're the only one  
  
There's never men like you  
Still  
That can come close to you  
Still  
Once I said I love you  
I knew you'd be the only one  
  
A good man you were to me  
Always there to care  
Would do anything in this world for me  
Didn't matter, what, when, or where  
You were there  
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start  
When I just wanted to get some attention  
And I'm sorry baby for bitchin  
If I could take back the words  
That I said to make you leave  
I'd be down on bended knees  
That's when you'd take me  
Forgive me  
  
You never know what you have  
Till it's gone  
Treated you wrong  
For so long  
Now you're gone away  
But the love still is here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All of the good times we had together (together)  
Do they mean somethin' to you  
Do you ever wish we never split (never)  
Still got love for you

"Said that you love me

"Holy cow! I think I've got one here  
Now just what am I supposed to do?  
I've got a number of irrational fears  
That I'd like to share with you  
  
First, there's rules about old goats like me  
Hangin' 'round with chicks like you -but I do like you-  
And another one: you say ""like"" too much  
  
But I'm shaking at your touch  
I like you way too much  
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you  
'N I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive  
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you  
  
Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?  
Just as I was bustin' loose  
I gotta go turn in my rock star card  
And get fat and old with you  
'Cause I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle month  
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder  
And I do like you - you're the lucky one  
No! I'm the lucky one

I admired the glowing the stars  
And tried to play a tune'

Just what he wanted I did not know

Where it was hard to find  
End up over here, got my ass on the line  
But I'll be right here until my work is done  
If I get back home, I hope I never see no more guns  
Here across the ocean  
I left some of my good friends behind  
I hope somebody's thinking about me

"Working for the devil  
You'll have to pay his tax  
That means going to see him  
Down among the racks  
You do his work so fine  
He'll remember you  
  
Worried for my friend  
As he shows me round the flat  
Where I don't want to find him  
His lips an' eyelids black  
He don't believe my speech  
That lines can and should be drawn  
Like if he had a shotgun  
The barrels would be sawn  
  
Swallowed by the river  
Swollen by the rains  
That leakin' ol' computer  
Of fingerprints and names  
Swimming in the river  
That floods the neighborhood  
I would call to you  
But it would do no good  
  
Voting for the law  
That's the general occupation  
First comes the public safety  
Second comes the nation  
You won't believe me now  
But there's been some illumination  
The wisest cops have realized  
They fucked the operation  
  
Cooking up the books  
A respected occupation  
The anchor and foundation of multi-corporations  
They don't believe in crime  
They don't know that it exists  
But to understand  
What's right and wrong  
The lawyers work in shifts  
  
'N speaking of the devil  
He ain't been seen for years  
'Cept every twenty minutes  
He zooms between me ears

For ciphers to the riddles  
An' reasons to the rhymes

"Keep the fire burning in your eyes  
Pay attention to the open sky  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
I don't remember losing track of you  
You're always dancing in and out of view  
I must have thought you would always be around  
Always keeping things real by playing the clown  
Now you're nowhere to be found  
I don't know what happens when people die  
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try  
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear  
But I can't sing, I can't help listening  
I can't help feeling stupid standing around  
Crying is the easier down  
'Cause I know that you would rather we'd be dancing  
Dancing our sorrow away  
No matter what fate throws in your way  
Just do the steps that you've been shown  
By everyone you've ever known  
Until the dance becomes your very own  
No matter how close to yours  
Another's steps have grown  
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone  
Keep a fire for the human race  
Let your prayers go drifting into space  
You'll never know what will be coming down  
Perhaps a better world is drawing near  
Just as easy it could all disappear  
Along with whatever meaning you might have found  
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around  
Go on and make a joyful sound  
Into a dancer you have grown  
From a seed somebody else has thrown  
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own  
And somewhere between the time you arrive  
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive  
But you'll never know

Darling, that you went away

Saying you'd come back and stay  
Don't come back now, it is too late  
My love for you has turned to hate  
  
Don't come back now on your knees  
Crying, ""Take me back, please""  
'Cause you can't mend my broken heart  
Because it died while we were apart  
  
Yes, I received your note today  
Saying you'd come back and stay  
Don't come back now, it is too late  
My love for you has turned to hate

The merchants roll their awnings down  
The milktrucks make their morning rounds

We'll rise up early, with the sun  
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning  
And the day is young

Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same  
  
We'll find a table in the shade  
And sip our tea and lemonade  
And watch the morning on parade  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
Ladies in their rainbow fashions  
Colored stop and go lights flashing  
We'll wink at total strangers passing in

Buy your dreams a dollar down  
Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same

A window full of colored rings

To make you smile, to win you with  
Are all the mornings still to live

Everything will be OK

Watch this cat, spin those drums  
Swing it Brother, beat that hyde!

Won't someone save me?  
  
She jumped aboard the brown line, I accidentally caught her eye  
She told me she was born a Libra, and I told her I was Gemini  
She made suggestive conversation, then she lightly brushed my hand  
Overcome by her temptation, we jumped off down by the strand  
And in the English night, oh I realize it again  
  
Oh no, I can't stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again  
Won't someone save me?  
  
She asks me to come inside, we could just talk for a while  
I wonder if I should, but her touch, her touch, it feels so good.  
I look into your eyes, and I realize it again.  
  
Oh no, I can't stop falling  
My heart betrays me  
And I know, I'll start to feel it all again  
Won't someone save me?

I drove down your road to hazeldean where I tasted your funeral  
Home's sandwiches and coffee I saw your hands melt into one another  
I saw you grieve and grow care a lot about one another

I looked out your kitchen window where I saw a  
Soulful gymnast melt in the air and shudder just above the snow  
Making moves that just weren't there ah velvet callow with wet

I'll show you what you should see  
I was gonna drive you home  
I was gonna tell you who I wanted  
I was gonna drive you home  
  
I'll never change for anyone

I know it's there but I can't see it  
A little light with you and me in it  
I know it's there but I can't see it

And whether they turn out good if they turn out bad  
I was going to take you home

I couldn't seem to find the words to say  
Now I have to live in yesterday

I thought that you were on my side  
I thought that I could keep our love alive  
I thought that I could keep her satisfied  
  
The clock keeps tickin and I keep on thinkin bout you  
I'm knockin at the door of your heart but I can't break through

She didn't even say goodbye  
I guess she didn't have the heart to try  
She didn't even have the guts to lie

Only you can turn the page  
And close the curtain on this empty stage  
Only you can take my pain away  
  
My heart keeps breakin and my body keeps aching for you  
Its time to hold on but theres nothin left to hold on to

"True lovers never take it slowly  
When they've found the one and only  
Nothing can replace this feeling  
Knowing someone loves you  
  
It's painted with the pain and glory  
Taking from a known sad story  
Laying out my life before me  
Fearing the unknown  
  
Sharing never showed me much appeal  
And now I'm only praying it's for real  
  
So how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
How does it feel  
  
How does it feel  
  
Forever taken you for granted  
You give me everything I wanted  
I'm so afraid that I might lose you  
But time will let us see  
If everything is real I'm feeling  
Well maybe we've been only dreaming  
And if it's gonna die to save it  
'cause baby I believe  
  
Nothing in the world could make it right  
'cause baby loving you brings me to life  
  
And how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people

Nothing in the world could feel this right

Covering all the gray that we see

But up comes the strongest wind  
That he sends to blow me back into his arms again  
  
And then the colors fall around my feet  
Over those I meet  
Changing all the gray that I see

Reflect the One

Hiding away  
Behind all those misty thunder clouds

Would you like to play  
With the thought of a friend  
In a distant passing stage  
While you lie around  
With your hands up and out  
So resigned you will fall down  
  
While you around here play  
Wild on the warm and far away  
While you around here play  
The days keep scribbling themselves in tidy lines  
  
Would you like to play  
With a fool holding hands  
With a one-eyed jack of spades  
While on the deck they sing  
All of the captain's cards are kings  
Still he and the queen are lost at sea  
I hope it isn't you or me

Still testing the strength  
Of our patience  
  
Oh, well she's only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her pointing to the Frisbee  
With a memory so fuzzy  
And her silent words  
Describing the fright of last night  
Four A.M. Northside, Clapham Common  
Oh, god, what was she doing there?  
Will she sketch the answer later?  
Well, I will ask her  
  
""Now dry your tears, my dear""  
Now see her mime in time so nicely  
It would all have been so clear  
If only she had never volunteered  
""Your taxi is here, my dear""  
  
La, la, la-la...

"In the straw-colored light  
In light rapidly changing  
On a life rapidly fading  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings a black embrade  
And white opals swimming  
In a child's leather purse  
Have you seen death swimming  
Have you seen death swimming  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings of youth enraged  
And the burning of Atlanta  
And these viral times  
And May ribbons streaming  
And straw-colored curls a-turning  
A mother's vain delight  
And woe to the sun  
And woe to the young  
Another hearse is drawn  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light

"All you have said is still in my ears  
You must have thought you're infallible  
Oh no oh no  
You're not gonna say that much anymore  
  
Welcome to my peculiar dream  
Fact is that I'm here  
I'm the master of reality  
Hard to see?  
But it's real and you will read me  
  
So many ways to go  
Before we're sanctified  
Few will be chosen ones  
Until we fade and die  
  
Kings will be kings  
Pawns will be pawns  
Aeons of tears  
Wildand severe  
Blessed be the young  
Strong enough to bear  
What before long will come  
Will be, might never disappear  
  
I know that pride's before the fall  
How can I fall if there's none left at all  
Tell me tell me  
How far can one fall from down below?  
  
It's either time or everyone round  
To show us what or who might be exchangable  
Disposable  
In the game of life we're playing  
  
Close to eternity  
I spread my wings and fly  
Like from a distant age  
I rule and you obey  
  
Kings will be kings  
Pawns will be pawns  
Aeons of tears  
Wild and severe  
Blessed be the young  
Strong enough to bear  
What before long will come  
Will be, might never disappear

"In a dream or a nightmare  
When love gives way to hate  
The quest begins  
For the keys to the seven gates  
Ride the wings of a locust  
See the wizard cast his spell  
Search for the keys to  
The seven gates of Hell  
In Heavens Hell  
Where all evil dwells  
And man and beast are one  
Conceiled to all  
Reveiled to none  
Lie those infernal gates  
Thoses damned infernal gates  
The seven gates of Hell  
Hear the cry of the zombie  
Raid the body of its soul  
The quest for the sacred keys  
Has become its goal  
Steal the wings of a hydra  
Take the sword from the sacred shrine  
The strength of the beast  
Take the sinners mind  
Unveiled in death to the sinner  
Written in the ancient book of lies  
Hear the demons call  
From the crimson waterfall  
As the blood rains from the skies  
When realities a dream  
And every lie is true  
In the day when you are me  
And the night when I am you  
When the flame of life grows cold  
We chime the silent bell  
And the unborn child is old  
The seven gates of Hell  
Going through the gates of Hell!  
Oh, in Heavens Hell  
So many died in vein  
They never lived, their tales to tell  
None shall find the keys  
To set their spirits free  
From the seven gates of Hell  
The seven gates  
The seven gates  
The seven gates...  
The seven gates of Hell  
I hear the creatures crawling  
Oh let me out of here  
Don't keep me locked away like this  
ohh... nooo......

Come and buy my little toys  
Monkeys made of gingerbread  
And sugar horses painted red

Their fathers dressed in hose  
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes  
Gazing eyes and running wild  
Past the stocks and over stiles  
Kiss the window merry child  
But come and buy my toys  
  
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn  
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn  
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, thrashed it with a quill  
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will  
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys  
Leave the parsley on the stalls  
Come and buy my toys  
  
You shall own a cambric shirt  
You shall work your father's land  
But now you shall play in the market square

"Suddenly before my eyes  
Hues of indigo arise  
With them how my spirit sighs  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Only night will ever know  
Why the heavens never show  
All the dreams there are to know  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Who has placed the midnight sky  
So a spirit has to fly?  
As the heavens seem so far now,  
Who will paint the midnight star?  
  
Night has brought to those who sleep  
Only dreams they cannot keep  
I have legends in the deep  
Paint the sky with stars  
  
Who has placed the midnight sky  
So a spirit has to fly?  
As the heavens seem so far now,  
Who will paint the midnight star?  
  
Place a name upon the night  
One to set your heart alight  
And to make the darkness bright  
Paint the sky with stars.

Wear cheap perfume cause its all they can afford,  
Go to discos they drink baby cham talk to jan, in bingo

They never win but that's not the point is it,  
Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat,  
How about that, far out!

Wallpaper lives cause they all die of cancer,  
What goes on, what goes wrong.

To selsey bill or bracklesham bay,  
Think about the future, when they'll settle down,  
Marry the girl next door, with one on the way.

Not given a thought, its the system,  
Hate the system, what's the system?

Precious moments caught within a spell  
All too soon our lives thay fade away  
These are the moments that we wish would stay  
  
If I had my life to live again  
I would choose to be with you my friend  
Time moves slowly and it goes so fast  
And who knows how long the days will last  
  
So cherish deep within you  
The love you get today  
Let the moment linger  
Cause tomorrow steals that away  
Yes tomorrow steals that away

Lives like stories that we long to tell  
When we're old with not too much to say

"[Violent J]  
Sitting in the class with my head on the desk  
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less  
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with  
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same  
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit  
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit  
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying  
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying  
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea  
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her  
Something's happening but it isn't very clear  
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair  
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall  
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall  
Some are yelling ""sick"" and the others stop and stare  
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere  
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted  
But I have a secret everybody missed it  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day  
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway  
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag  
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag  
[Violent J]  
I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong  
But since nobody knows me I got it going on  
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock  
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock  
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me  
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me  
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move  
A dead body rotting in the back of the room  
For weeks and months, stinking up the class  
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus  
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  
But I have a key, it's called insanity  
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
""Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn  
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the  
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all  
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community  
And we are alternate equals. Yes?""  
""Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?""  
""Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now.""  
[Violent J]  
No, they can sit and front about it all day  
But I left his fucking body in the hallway  
And in the morning they opened up the door  
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor  
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd  
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard  
I could chop my arms off and run around the class  
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast  
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker  
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter  
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah  
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out  
And the class wanna know who could it be  
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me  
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag

"The current is strong from what I've heard  
I'll whisk you down the stream  
But I never seem to have the time  
So my toes just touch the water  
So my toes just touch the water  
  
Daydreamed on the bank again  
I was swimming with the fish  
And I thought this time that it may be true  
But my toes just touched the water [Repeat: x3]  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now I'm here and I can't begin  
to move  
  
Walked a mile just to find the edge  
Some place low enough  
to step right in  
Now I'm here and I can't begin  
to move

Always has to have its way  
And I know that the river's there to shelter me  
But my toes just touched the water [Repeat: x3]

"I can see that look that says beware  
Try to move in closer if you dare  
So I must sit and play  
My waiting game  
And for a while I know  
She'll do the same  
Fly away  
  
Watches like an eagle from its eyrie  
And like a bird of prey  
She captures me  
But I am older and  
More wise than you  
Bird of prey  
Straight into me you flew  
Fly away  
  
Now every time I tried to set her free  
I'm glad to say she comes  
Right back to me  
But if I knew she didn't want to stay  
I wouldn't try to keep that

"It's funny how money change a situation  
Miscommunication leads to complication  
My emancipation don't fit your equation  
I was on the humble, you on every station  
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb  
But remember not a game new under the sun  
Everything you did has already been done  
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston  
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run  
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent  
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun  
Can't take a threat to mi new born son  
L's been this way since creation  
A groupie call, you fall from temptation  
Now you want to ball over separation  
Tarnish my image in your conversation  
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
Now, now how come your talk turn cold?  
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul  
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control  
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold  
Wisdom is better than silver and gold  
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful  
Every man want to act like he's exempt  
Need to get down on his knees and repent  
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment  
Your movement's similar to a serpent  
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?  
Consequence is no coincidence  
Hypocrites always want to play innocent  
Always want to take it to the full out extent  
Always want to make it seem like good intent  
Never want to face it when it time for punishment  
I know you don't want to hear my opinion  
But there come many paths and you must choose one  
And if you don't change then the rain soon come  
See you might win some, but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done? it's so silly how come?  
You just lost one  
  
Now don't you understand man universal law?  
What you throw out comes back to you, star  
Never underestimate those who you scar  
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!  
You can't hold god's people back that long  
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong  
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond  
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong  
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song  
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone  
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn  
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn  
Now, some might listen and some might shun  
And some may think that they've reached perfection  
If you look closely you'll see what you've become  
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You just lost one  
What a bum-bum

"In the gloom the gathering storm abates  
In the ships gimlet eyes await  
The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach  
  
Overlord, your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive  
  
[Chorus x2:]  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
  
The rising dead, faces bloated torn  
They are relieved, the living wait their turn  
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name  
You still go on, to hell and back again  
  
Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall  
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand, we will prevail  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive

Once, when night seemed forever  
I was with you.  
  
Once, in the care of morning  
In the air was all belonging.  
Once, when that day was dawning  
I was with you.  
  
How far we are from morning,  
How far we are  
And the stars shining through the darkness,  
Falling in the air.  
  
Once, as the night was leaving  
Into us our dreams were weaving.  
Once, all dreams were worth keeping.

Once, when our hearts were singing,  
I was with you.

What can lift my lowest thoughts  
To the very throne of God?  
And what can lift my eyes from earthly things?

"You think you're alone there in your silent storm  
But i've seen the tears you've cried falling down and trying to drown  
The flame of hope inside  
Let me tell you now, tell you now  
  
(chorus)  
When you're walking in the dead of night  
And your soul is churning  
When your hope seems out of sight  
Keep the candle burning  
All it takes is one steady heart in a world that's turning  
Shine a light and pierce the dark  
Keep the candle burning  
Keep the candle burning  
  
When you're down and you're discouraged  
When the darkness clouds your view  
You've got to gather up your courage  
You know the lord is gonna see you through  
Let me tell you now  
Tell you now  
  
(repeat chorus)  
One ray of light always breaks through  
Follow wherever he takes you  
Wherever he takes you

"I hate long goodbyes, fuck off and die

You can stab me in the back and then cut all ties

Want me to spell it out for you?

And tell myself that lonely night we parted  
I got a lifetime to regret.

The things I said the night we said goodbye, dear  
Oh, I got a lifetime to regret.  
  
If we could just erase the mistakes we made, dear  
I'm sure we could find happy moments yet  
But we can't change the past and I'm afraid, dear

Do you know what I know

Let us bring Him silver and gold  
Let us bring Him silver and gold

"I should've kept my eyes shut  
But I had to go and peep  
But when you saw what I saw  
Well, it's hard just to roll back to sleep  
  
I would've kept my eyes shut  
But I thought I heard you scream  
And I've a penchant for violence  
You don't seem to find in a dream  
  
The scene a little clearer

And in the cage, centre-stage  
It's mother who's destined to choke  
  
And she choke and we choke  
On the words that we wish we'd not spoke  
Just when you felt you had someone to trust  
Out comes the man with the dagger and cloak  
  
I should've read the novels  
Believed every word  
But the stories they wrote  
Were so different to ones that I'd heard  
  
I should've kept my eyes shut  
My mouth should've closed  
But the mixture of vomit and blood  
Just crept up through my nose  
  
It became a little clearer  
As soon as I awoke  
My father stands with rope in hand  
A screaming mother kneels in hope  
  
And she hope and we hope  
That me words that she said won't provoke  
A smile is removed and a petal is crushed  
What once was a laugh has turned into a joke  
  
You should've kept your mouth shut

Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome

Puff of white smoke knocked me out

Is this in limbo or in Heaven or Hell?  
Maybe I'm going down there as well,  
I can't accept my soul will drift forever.  
I feel myself floating back down to Earth,  
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?  
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

"As I walk these narrow streets  
Where a million passin feet have trod before me  
With my guitar in my hand  
Suddenly I realize nobody knows me  
  
Where yesterday the multitude  
Screamed and cried my name out for a song  
Today the streets are empty  
And the crowds have all gone home  
  
I pass a million houses  
But there is no place that I belong  
All I knew to give you  
Was song after song after song  
  
All the truths I tried to tell you  
Were as distant to you as the moon  
Born 200 years too late  
And 200 years too soon  
  
I'm a child of this age  
Locked into the pages of your book  
And when I am but dust and clay  
And all the children stop to take a look  
  
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform  
And the heights I did aspire  
Or will they tear out the pages of the book  
To light a fire  
  
With the rain on my face  
There is no place that I belong  
Did you forget this fucking singer so soon?  
And did you forget my song?

"Let's take the final step and get married cause a true love is all I'm looking
for  
  
Well I hope someday that I'll make you a million  
  
Cause right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
But I've got two arms that were made just to hold you tight  
  
And a real love to keep you satisfied  
  
And I've got two lips that are just for kissing yours goodnight  
  
And these two eyes that will never see you cry  
  
I'd like to give you diamond rings from the start  
  
But right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
Your love can't be bought for any price I know  
  
Though I'd give anything to call you mine  
  
But thank God you want me for just what I am  
  
Cause right now all that I can give you is my heart  
  
Right now all that I can give you is my heart

"Someone to hold you too close  
Someone to hurt you too deep  
Someone to sit in your chair  
And ruin your sleep  
And make you aware of being alive  
  
Someone to need you too much  
Someone to know you too well  
Someone to pull you up short  
And put you through hell  
And give you support for being alive-being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody hold me too close  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you of being alive,  
Being alive, being alive!  
  
Someone you have to let in  
Someone whose feelings you spare  
Someone who, like it or not  
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody crowd me with love  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through

I'm not gonna let you go and run around  
I need to know that you'll be true to me

"All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
That Memphis, girl  
Don't hold a thing for you  
Hypnotized by gypsy lies  
Like a moth drawn to the flame  
In the crowd  
You're just a faceless face  
Another nameless name  
Living on the handouts  
Of the Jesus of your own choosing  
The Christ you knew  
In Memphis, girl  
Could not win for losin'  
Love beeds for your rosary  
And your drugs to see you through  
You're telling me  
At seventeen  
You know more that I do  
Say farewell to L.A  
And your little coat of blue  
'Cause meanwhile  
Back in Memphis, girl  
Our mama prays for you  
All the way from Memphis, babe  
In search of something new  
You tell me now  
At seventeen  
You know more than I do

"For every just man mocked and killed  
For every drop of black contagion spilled  
This is my house  
This is my evil  
For every battle lost and won  
The spangled banners flapping in the sun  
This is my blood  
This is my people  
The black drums leaking in their graves  
The tin cans rocking on the arctic waves  
For every child the streets will claim  
The curse that rushes through her tiny veins  
For every rose that wilts away  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
For every field of wasted grain  
The rockets standing 'neath the western plains  
This is my greed  
This is my glory  
For every fist raised to the sky  
The crimes of hate our young sons glorify  
For every mouth that yearns for bread  
The heart of stone proclaiming  
God is dead  
For every soul that lost its way  
I die a little more each day  
Just a little more each day  
A little more each day  
For all the blessings I disown  
The cruelities I condone  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come  
For every beast of land and sky and sea  
That suffers for my vanity  
For every sin under the sun  
For all the tears from here to kingdom come

That everything I feel, has got to be real

I'm a bad boy but still there's so much good in me  
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me  
I needa girl to feel herself but can still feel me  
Just let me be ya only choice no need for plan B!  
My love life is malnutrition's you my vitamin C  
Stay down like Hillary and I can be ya billy  
I'll buy ya jada pinky pinkies I'm the biggest willy  
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playin' Frisby  
I can do it by myself but I'd be very lonely  
Be the diva who's my lover and my closest homie  
So if you sick and tired of bein' sick and tired call me  
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci! (Gucci!)

Ain't no need in arguin' about it  
If you wanna leave then just be bout it  
There's no sense in blamin' me and me blamin' you  
There's no reason to be untrue everything  
I got I work hard for everyday I work hard to  
Make more I can do bad all by myself  
I ain't tryna play love games cause I can do bad baby

"Wait for me I'll understand  
I just need time to comprehend your changes  
There's always been these changes in you  
I remember that there was a time when  
Fears we had we left behind and we danced  
But it seems the more we learn  
We learn that it's  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
  
Forget if you can  
The way you moved when our hands touched  
You forced me to force you  
Do you remember the dreams,  
the nightmares we shared?  
The poison of love so pure it's deceiving  
And deceit is all we have it's got to be over  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
Over, Over  
Too late to take a chance again it's over

"I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner  
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown  
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets  
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown  
  
I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple  
I was licking my lips till his Son come down  
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
I'm taking a turn in the right direction  
By leaving his soul in the lost and found  
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown  
  
I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock them  
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing the crown  
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps  
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout ""Hey I'm chasing the crown""

"Hearts were exploding around us  
As we drifted south down the bay.  
The gray up above and gray down below  
Left us with nothing to say.  
So we drifted along in silence  
Till the tickle of life trickled in.  
And the rhythm began in the hiss of the sand,  
We were catching fire again.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.  
  
Yeah, we finally caught up with legends,  
We were walking along side by side.  
We worked out a plan to go out hand in hand,  
The long trail just wasn't that wide.  
The water around us was freezing,  
We just laughed and threw ourselves in.  
And although we were old,  
The sting of that cold pumped up the feeling,  
Here it is again.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.  
  
Oh, I'm a message in a bottle  
Drifting along on a deep blue sea.  
Waiting for some foreign shore,  
Ready for something to be.  
  
No longer afraid of falling,  
We cut the strings to the sky.  
We found lever ground  
And we put ourselves down,  
Amazing we all didn't die.  
We took each moment as given,  
By second they came.  
The ice and the sun  
And the thundering guns,  
Good God I was finally sane.  
  
Oh boatman, I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
Oh holy roller,  
I am the river,  
I am the mountain and the sea.  
Oh boatman, taker and giver,  
Can you deliver me?  
I would forever run free.

"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dresses up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said  
Many times many ways

"Once upon a time there was a tavern  
Where we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things we would do  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes, those were the days  
Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance, I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another, and we'd say  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes, those were the days  
Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Was that lonely man really me  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....  
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

"Here we are, two very bewildered people  
Here we are, two babes that are lost in the wood  
We're not quite certain what has happened to us  
This lovely thing that's so marvelous  
But right from here, the future looks awfully good.  
  
Our love affair was meant to be  
It's me for you dear, and you for me  
We'll fuss and quarrel  
And tears start to brew  
But after the tears, our love will smile through  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide  
The thrill I get when you're by my side  
And when we're older, we'll proudly declare  
""Wasn't ours a lovely love affair?""  
  
I'm sure that I could never hide

Time comes and goes so quiet now  
Leaves emptiness behind our eyes

From an hour of the pain

To cover up the cold

But you did not tell me when  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Oh, maybe I can't see what's plainly in my view  
Oh, I wish I was a better man, maybe it's just you  
But there's something goin' on here  
Like a wound that will not mend

Nervous wreck  
I can't believe you said goodbye  
  
Sit and smoke

About these tears in my eyes

I wouldn't treat a dog the way you treated me

"How can I not taste it  
When it's right there put it in my hand  
And let's not put it in their faces  
Hide the obvious just a little bit

They're just a face all covered with a rag  
And they can't stop talking,  
So the bigger it gets  
And yeah they take up space but still nothing's wasted  
  
A lie is a lie with crossed hearts and hopes to die

I tried not to use it cause' I can  
And don't tell me what a race is  
Cause I can get fucked up more than a little bit

We pay to watch it wasted,  
They're just a face all covered with a rag.  
And they might keep running,  
But the slower they move.  
And those moves in time with their perfect placement.

Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine

Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass

There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee  
Sure there's no one in in this wide world as happy as we

I hope she's safe landed without any shock  
If ever we should meet again by land or by sea

Soon begins bewitching me

Wanna laugh like a loon

"They used to tell me boy you ain't goin' nowhere  
With your cheap guitar and your big long hair  
You gotta realize all your responsibilities  
You gotta get out to work and face reality  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road  
  
So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin  
I couldn't find my way I didn't know what I was doin'  
I saw a lot of people coming back the other way  
So I kept on goin' when I heard them say  
  
""You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road""  
  
I made a lot of money I was makin' quite a mess  
But they all told me money wouldn't bring me happiness  
""You gotta work like a man in a real man's life  
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife""

"I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...  
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood?  
  
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,  
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.  
  
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine  
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed""  
  
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.  
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath  
  
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown  
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?

"When I was you we walked to school  
And I carried your books 'cause even then I was a fool  
But you grew up and said goodbye  
I still remember the things that made me cry  
  
For all too soon my story ends  
I found a love, now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
  
I held your hand and I told you things  
And I made you believe, believe in fairy tales  
And diamond rings  
  
Hen all too soon my story ends  
I found a love ,now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child

"Envy of, a sense of true identity, a sign of confidence to see.  
Because when she said ""I love that music, too,""  
She meant, ""Only as long as you want me too.""  
So sad, we don't see, until we become what they want us to be.  
It's too late.  
I don't know why,  
But what they want me to do,  
I do it.  
Powered by wealth,  
Changing myself,  
And if they only knew that I knew it.  
And it seems that the real life will have to wait,  
Because the world's so busy,  
So busy, cleaning a clean slate.  
Oh.  
Ahh, hoping to find what's mine,  
So I can lead a full life,  
Use a knife,  
And dig in like a cannibal.  
Out for,  
For myself, but all the things I want are serving someone else.  
I don't know why,  
But what they want me to do,  
I do it.  
Powered by wealth,  
Changing myself,  
And if they only knew that I knew it.  
And it seems that the real life will have to wait.  
As the world keeps cleaning, it's cleaning.

for she could make you feel strong

But every time I ask you out  
(time I ask you out)  
We never move past friendly no,no  
  
And you never how  
I stare when we're alone  
Or wonder why I keep you on the phone  
  
I've made it obvious  
Done everything but sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long but on and on you get me wrong)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
Yeah  
  
You are my very first thought in the morning  
  
And my last at nightfall  
  
You are my love that came without warning  
  
Mark and Shane:  
I need you  
I want you to know  
  
I've made it obvious  
So finally I'll sing it  
(I've crushed on you so long)  
I'm not so good with words  
And since you never notice  
The way that we belong  
I'll say it in a love song  
  
And sing it until the day you're holding me  
I've wanted you so long but on and on you get me wrong  
I more then adore you but since you never seem to see  
  
But you never seem to see  
I'll say it in this love song

"Overhead the albatross  
Hangs motionless upon the air  
And deep beneath the rolling waves  
In labyrinths of coral caves  
An echo of a distant time  
Comes willowing across the sand  
And everything is green and submarine.  
  
And no one called us to the land  
And no one knows the where's or why's.  
Something stirs and something tries  
Starts to climb toward the light.  
  
Strangers passing in the street  
By chance two separate glances meet  
And I am you and what I see is me.  
And do I take you by the hand  
And lead you through the land  
And help me understand  
The best I can.  
  
And no one called us to move on,  
And no one forces down our eyes.  
No one speaks and no one tries  
No one flies around the sun  
  
Cloudless everyday you fall  
Upon my waking eyes,  
Inviting and inciting me  
To rise.  
And through the window in the wall  
Come streaming in on sunlight wings  
A million bright ambassadors of morning.  
  
And no one sings me lullabys  
And no one makes me close my eyes  
So I throw the windows wide  
And call to you across the sky

",Echoes,Pink Floyd
"I look at photographs of you  
Sweat and shame till the sun comes through  
I think of things I ought not to  
I've hung your memory on the wall  
A life-size portrait ten feet tall  
I feel my skin begin to crawl  
Suddenly I see you take a breath  
And out of the cameras you come through  
Is it you  
Must be my imagination  
Must be my imagination  
Must be the shock waves of the moon  
The entertainment of a lonely room  
The devil playing that same old tune  
'cause something strange is happening to me  
Feel in the land of make believe  
Please look me up and swallow the key  
'cause I feel your fingers running through my hair  
I feel the human touch of you  
Must be my imagination  
Must be my imagination

"I walked into a diner  
And the blonde behind the counter  
She asked if she could help in any way  
Hell, I knew by her smile  
Her number I could dial  
If I was in the need of company  
But as I bought some Java  
Instead she brought me a cup of chicory  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee

Coffee's got me

Oh coffee  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
Don't pour me water just fill up my cup  
You know it takes a lot just to keep me up  
Cost may be more than you care to pay  
What good is money compared to fightin' pain  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat  
The only pick me up that's here to stay  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me

Oh coffee, coffee, coffee

Oh coffee, oh coffee

Coffee's got me  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
The taste of Java is like a cocaine rush  
Nobody's gonna stop me from drinkin' too much  
Down in Bolivia the people are insane  
They want as much for coffee as they do for cocaine  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat

"I'll only miss her when I think of her  
And I'll think of her all the time  
Likely I'll spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase  
Things I found hard to praise, right now, would seem sublime  
  
And the truth is  
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs  
'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
  
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears  
I'll bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years

And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way

But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song

If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say

Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love

Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.

Maybe in won't, praying it may

In a cafe on Main Street  
With mouths to feed  
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs

When I think of where I've been, what I've done and all I own  
How I think I know everything, like I made it here on my own  
And like the wind that blows, like a flower that grows  
Still with all I can do  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I admit that sometimes pride tries to hide my view  
And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You  
And all the many days and many ways Your grace I've abused  
Still you were patient and Your love loved me through  
But the wind still blows and the flower still grows and one thing is still
true.  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal  
Without You, nothing in this world is for real  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Can't live, can't see Your will for me  
Can't do anything  
Anything  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend

Without You, we're just actors on a stage

Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Without You, we're like a bride with no groom  
Without You, it's like seeing no sunshine in June  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
We wouldn't be here today  
Without You, Jesus my life would be lost.  
Without You, I'll never know what it cost  
To see You, lay Your life down for me  
From my past now I'm free  
Tell me where would I be without You.  
Tell me where would I be without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles

To a the school yard to expose his dick and balls made of snow

His dick did grow when he packed snow  
On his cold and icy crotch  
  
There must have must have been some magic  
When he stroked his frozen meat  
Cause frosty started moaning loud  
And it began to sleet cum and white trash pussy

Was as glad as he could get  
He threw away his corn cob pipe  
And lit a cigarette

Didn't want to go to jail  
He began to run  
While dripping cum  
And the cops picked up his trail  
  
Down to the village  
His dick melting in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Yelling ""catch me if you can.""  
  
They chased him down the streets of town  
Right to a Vice Squad cop  
Who shoved a night stick right up his ass  
And frosty screamed ""don't stop OOOO!""

Was locked up that very day  
But he did not cry  
As he waved good bye knowing he'd be back someday

Sliding his hands  
All over his glands

To look through panes of shaded glass

Learning how to rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...  
  
He learnt to rock and roll  
And sing the blues  
He learnt to head shake  
While singing blue suede shoes  
He learnt a hand clap  
Off the beat  
And at the gig he had them out of their seats  
It's the only way to do it so long live rock and roll  
  
Cause he would rock in the kitchen roll in the hall  
Stand on the tv and climb up the wall  
Jive on the ceiling lay on the floor  
Crawl through the bathroom and cry out for more  
And that's the only way to do it  
When you're learning how to rock and roll  
Teach me to rock...

"Days are short, and I ain't down  
The sun is on the hill  
Looking in my suitcase for a friend  
The door was opened wide  
You know I lost a little pride  
And inside it was just another man  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Every day another man reaches out his hand  
Every moment there's a shifting in the sand  
Every whisper in the wind  
Brings a good man back again  
Settle me down in my dreams tonight  
Tomorrow's another day to blow my blues away  
  
Lots of folks will tell you that  
A man can go through' life  
Taking what he wants along the way  
But until all men are freed  
Each one gets but what he needs  
The experience of living every day  
  
[CHORUS:]  
  
I woke up this morning  
I awoke upon my knees  
Crying oo-wee, I don't know where I am

Because, after all, I'm just another man

That is how it used to be  
So many years ago yeah  
These days we' re living in  
Everything needs a dollar  
These days we' re living in  
Everything needs some money  
You can' t get no love without the dollar  
You can' t get no justice without the dollar  
So everything is.........  
  
[Chorus:]  
Money money money  
  
Judge dread I know I' ve done something wrong here  
And today you' re here  
To put me away forever  
But before you bring that hammer down  
Look what I have in my hand  
Yeah, the wheels of justice  
They turn so slow  
But with this we can make them turn faster  
Than a rocket in my favour  
Doesn't matter what they say  
I've done here today  
Just look the other way  
Like you always do  
When you see......

You're so honest

"A fine romance, with no kisses  
A fine romance, my friend this is  
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes  
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes  
A fine romance, you won't nestle  
A fine romance, you won't wrestle  
I might as well play bridge  
With my old maid aunt  
I haven't got a chance  
This is a fine romance  
  
A fine romance, my good fellow  
You take romance, I'll take jello  
You're calmer than the seals  
In the Arctic Ocean  
At least they flap their fins  
To express emotion  
A fine romance with no quarrels  
With no insults and all morals  
I've never mussed the crease  
In your blue serge pants  
I never get the chance  
This is a fine romance

Like the river joins the ocean, as the germ in a seed grows

"I'm impossible she's exciting  
Bound together with joined up writing  
In the church  
I heard a bell ring  
In a bar  
I heard a girl sing  
She sings solo I see double  
Moments vanish her love so subtle

Words were few  
And realizing  
I was deep in my points of view  
So interested to talk to you talk to you

By her song

I'm shy but eager

I hope to see her  
On the stage with her velvet voice  
Though some would say that it's just a noise  
I bit off more than I could chew  
So interested in my points of view points of view

"C'mon, kind Sir, let's walk outside  
And breathe the autumn air  
See the many that have lived and died  
See the unending golden stair  
See all of us that have come behind  
Clutching at your hem  
All the way from Arkansas  
To your sweet and last amen  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing  
  
Take this deafening thunder down  
Take this bread and take this wine  
Your passing is not what we mourn  
But the world you left behind  
Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound  
And behold your mighty work  
That towers over the uncaring ground  
Of a lesser, darker world  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing  
  
There are those of us not fit to tie  
The laces of your shoes  
Must remain behind to testify  
Through an elementary blues  
So, let's walk outside, the hour is late  
Through your crumbs and scattered shells  
Where the awed and the mediocre wait  
Barely fit to ring the bells  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing

"I walked with you and talked with you and held your loving hand  
We loved awhile I lived awhile and thought that fate had it planned  
Then someone stole my angel and I lost what I loved most  
I may never get to heaven but I once came mighty close  
I may never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings  
Or walk a golden staircase while the distant chorus sings  
Oh but I once held your sweet love and felt your tender touch

"All alone  
Wishing on stars  
Waiting for you to find me  
  
One sweet night  
I knew I would see  
A stranger who'd be my friend  
  
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Like it was written in the stars, I knew  
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you  
  
""Thank you.""

We'll always be  
Walking the world together

Where dreams never end

When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Look for the rainbow in the sky

Could never really say goodbye

Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain  
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain  
  
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained  
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train

'Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains  
  
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim  
Get shot or stuck up standin at them see-Lo games

Be saying ""That's nasty"", wouldn't give me no brain

'Cause one day it could happen""

But who would of believed that one day I'd be trapped in - no

Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline  
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined  
  
But on a small island, too far for police to find  
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined

She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time  
  
Some be like ""At least you signed""  
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines  
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime  
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime

And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind  
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

I could walk through and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson

Looking at her face would confirm your worst fears

But everybody's too afraid to hear what he's talking about

"Here's a song for all the little men, who get forgotten  
Trodden time and time again  
Here's a message for the little guy, don't let this situation pass you by  
You're in the middle while the big mouths fight  
You get it from the left and the right, ain't it crazy  
  
So get out of your easy chairs, we've got a lot to do out there  
Well ain't we  
Good's gone bad but right is wrong and I don't know which side I'm on lately  
  
Get up from the down you are in  
Come out of your homes and let's see your faces  
Get up out of your easy chairs, get up and show 'em that you're there  
Get up it's your one salvation  
Wise up to the situation  
  
Somebody gotta get up and shout  
Somebody gotta give us some clout  
You're the ones to make it all work out  
It all depends on you  
  
Get up off your arses men  
Don't let 'em think you're getting lazy  
Get up out of your easy chairs  
We gotta lot to do out there, well ain't we  
Get up, get up, get up,  
Get up, get up, get up

"Well, everytime I try to love another  
I never know exactly what to do  
I'd like to tell her just how much I want her  
And I could find the way if she were you  
Her eyes may shine for me and not another,  
Her lonely arms reach out to hold me too,  
She wants to take your place and be my lover  
And I could make her mine if she were you  
I never knew how much I cared about you  
Till your memory made me a lovesick fool  
When she speaks to me I hear you sweet voice calling  
When I close my eyes your face comes into view  
I remember how it hurt when I was falling  
And I could fall again if she were you

Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill

Like I don't think anyone's real,  
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step
beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer  
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,  
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama  
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,  
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza  
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a
row,  
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,  
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,  
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,  
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate  
And which motel which lake they found her in,  
And how they attacked the victim,  
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,  
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,  
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like  
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light  
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way  
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?  
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms  
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,  
He can give her some, she can give him some  
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome  
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm  
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up  
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a  
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises  
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes  
You stare into your stereos eyes  
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,

"I've been here before  
But always hit the floor  
I've spent a lifetime running  
And I always get away  
But with you I'm feeling something  
That makes me want to stay  
  
I'm prepared for this  
I never shoot to miss  
But I feel like a storm is coming  
If I'm gonna make it through the day  
Then there's no use in running  
This is something I gotta face  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall  
  
A million shards of glass  
That haunt me from my past  
As the stars begin to gather  
And the light begins to fade  
When all hope begins to shatter  
Know that I won't be afraid  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall

"Ours is just another skin  
That simply slips away  
You can rise above it  
It will shed easily  
  
It all will come out fine

One common wire  
One silver thread

Rolls on ahead  
  
Like a ship in a bottle  
Held up to the sun  
Sails ain't going nowhere  
You can count every one  
Until it crashes unto the earth  
And simply slips away  
You can hide in the open  
Or just disappear  
  
Ours is just a craving  
And a twist of the wrist  
Will undo the stopper  
With abrupt tenderness  
Die little sparrow  
And awake

One silver thread

But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it  
Who else, who else is gonna  
It's dedicated to all you bitches  
  
Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass  
Blew my hole in the past  
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea  
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina  
Boy you shoulda seen her  
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's  
Called up talkin' Tina  
I put my dick in a womb  
She blew my head like a balloon  
I had her walkin' on the moon  
  
Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time  
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind  
You walked by smellin' like watermelon  
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'  
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick  
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick  
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy  
After that we can cheat  
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat  
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke  
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke  
Compound porno flick music  
Daddy came with it when I wrote it  
  
Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog  
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch  
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie  
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy  
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty  
I like it muddy or swampy  
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky  
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV  
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease  
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze  
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch  
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese  
Now to blow fifty G's overseas  
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850  
  
Suicidal  
She been in more hotels than bibles  
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle  
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue  
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split  
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot  
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web  
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf  
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons  
Big ass in tight denim  
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed  
To watch relationships get destroyed  
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless  
Her attitude was blameless  
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list  
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection  
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection  
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em  
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom  
  
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible  
(That's exactly what we've done)  
But you'll fail, and you'll all die  
(If we die, the next generation will fight them too  
And the one after them, for as long as they must  
And eventually we shall succeed)

"I'm just a lonely cavegirl  
Searching for a date  
Looking for cave romance  
Or at least a caveman date  
  
My momma says I must wait here  
Until the moon is bright  
With cakes, milk and honey as gifts for the Gods  
Or as snack food for Mr. Right  
  
Now crawl around three times  
On your hands and knees  
And if the face of a handsome man comes into view  
Then he's your caveman love

What caveman in his right mind would go for a crawling, circling cavegirl  
Like -  
Oh, are you the man for me?

Is all I'd hoped he would be  
He likes to go out hunting  
Then I cook it for his tea  
  
I promise to love him forever  
Until he's old and grey  
He'll live to the grand age of thirty  
At which point he'll probably pass away  
  
But that doesn't mean you stop loving him  
'Cause now you have to prepare  
A burial to show how much you care  
For your caveman love  
  
First I set fire to my husband  
Then carefully cut off his skin  
Boil in a pot some oysters and snakes  
Let the funeral begin  
Drop in some limpets and winkles  
And sprinkles of mouse, toad and shrew  
Then put out the fire with the cauldron  
And say au revoir to my caveman love

"I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.  
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,  
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.  
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.  
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that  
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep.  
  
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.  
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.  
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.  
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam.  
  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.  
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.  
And I'm all dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,  
And even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt.  
  
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.  
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not all there.  
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance,  
But even backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance.

Not knowin' where I's bound  
No one could change my mind but mama tried  
  
One and only rebel child  
In a family meek and mild,  
Mama seemed to know what lay in store  
In spite of all my Sunday learnin',  
For the bad I kept on turnin'  
Mama couldn't hold me anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I turned twenty one in prison  
Doin' life without parole  
No one could steer me right  
But mama tried, mama tried,  
Mama tried to raise me better  
But her pleadin' I denied,  
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried  
  
Dear old daddy, rest his soul,  
Left my mom a heavy load  
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes  
Workin' hours without rest,  
Wanted me to have the best,  
She tried to raise me right but I refused  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

"It's only been a hour since you left me  
But it feels like a million days  
If I had a magic wand I could turn back time  
I'd never let you go away  
  
I didn't have the heart to say I'm sorry  
Now I haven't got a heart at all  
I could tolerate the pain if I could talk to my best friend  
But you won't even call  
  
I'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase  
And packing everything I own  
I didn't back then but I do know now  
Wherever you are is home  
I'll crawl on my belly and beg you  
But you're so far away  
You've only been gone for an hour  
But it seems like a million days

"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia,  
California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh,  
On across Caroline.  
  
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,  
And we never was a minute late.  
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,  
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.  
  
We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,  
Half way 'cross Alabam,  
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded  
In downtown Birmingham.  
  
Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,  
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean  
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham  
Smoking into New Orleans.  
  
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana  
Just help me get to Houston town.  
There's people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let the poor boy down.  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,  
Put luggage in my hands,  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque  
On a jet to the promised land.

We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.

And let me make it to the telephone.

Prisoner, slave to the disguise  
  
Disappear the only thing

Knew that it was time  
To say goodbye

When I sensed I was not alone  
She said d'you know how to spell audaciously  
I could tell I was in luck  
And so I forced a smile contrary to my style  
And she looked into my eyes  
She said d'you want to go heaven  
Or would you rather not be saved

I'm on my way, will you not see

I won't read your poetry, oh sweetness please

Which was down on charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention  
We were not intense, not least because  
Well if you must just take then I'm a piece of cake  
That is what she said to me  
And so I gave myself to her charity  
Well at least that's how it seemed  
Here comes my train

I won't read your poetry, oh bittersweets

One little Christmas tree that never had grown  
Cried as he looked up to the sky,

I'm so afraid and so alone.  
Could one little Christmas tree  
So tiny and small light up someone's home?""  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little child can find a toy.  
One little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little heart can find some joy.

Cried as she looked down at the tree,  
""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, wherever you are  
May I give him the star you gave to me?""  
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar  
A voice that was heard throughout the world,  
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star,  
Tonight he'll light the world!""  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree  
Can light up the world  
So those who are lost may find their way.  
One little Christmas tree can light up the world  
So all men may see on Christmas day.

When we know there's nothing more  
Take the hand or fist  
Just to sell ourselves for this  
The path we least resist  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see  
Fighting in futility  
  
[Verse 2 - Mike]  
Uh, I give you what you came for  
This is not the same though  
Got a different method  
But I still can bring the pace so  
Not all give the same though  
I got down the same flow  
I ain't shock and get you  
Never really in my range, though  
Somehow they ain't grow. High five, bango  
All pride childs. Mama let the bass bang though  
All you fucking lames go  
Yelling out the names though  
Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for  
(Careful what you shoot, cause you might hit what you came for)  
  
No control! No surprise!  
Throw the keys to the kingdom down there  
Down the hole in my eye  
I'm my own casualty! I fuck up everything I see

"Way down in Bowling Green the prettiest girls I've ever seen  
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky to love down in Bowling Green  
Bowling Green folks treat you kind better you think your own mind

Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold  
It warms your body and I know it touches the soul

"It's love I'm after  
North, South, East and West  
I have gone in my quest,  
Far, wide  
  
High and low  
This one thing I know  
It's love I'm after  
I don't want to be a millionaire,  
The only thing on earth  
For which I care is love  
  
Ba da da da da do  
For love and laughter,  
For love and laughter  
I give all that I posses  
Don't you know the only  
  
Name for happiness  
Is love, love, love  
Rich man, poor man,  
Beggar man, thief,  
Feel the way I do  
Because each one of them believes  
He'll find somebody like you  
  
It's love I'm after,  
Love, I'm after,  
Love, it's love I'm after,  
It may make me rise or make me fall,  
But it's love I'm after,  
After all.

"Well I lived on the outskirts of town  
In an eight room farmhouse, baby  
When my brothers and friends were around  
There was always somethin' doin'  
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends  
Stopped by to see me every once in a while  
When I think back about those days  
All I can do is sit and smile  
  
[Chorus]  
That's when a sport was a sport  
And groovin' was groovin'  
And dancin' meant everything  
We were young and we were improvin'  
Laughin', laughin' with our friends  
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby  
Outside the club ""Cherry Bomb""

Say yeah yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
  
The winter days they last forever  
But the weekends went by so quick  
Went ridin' around this little country town  
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks  
One night, me with my big mouth  
A couple guys had to put me in my place  
When I see those guys these days  
We just laugh and we say ""do you remember when?""

If we've done any wrong  
I hope that we're forgiven

And some days I still don't know what to do  
I hope that they're not laughing too loud  
When they hear me talkin'  
Like this to you

"Marching across our own screens  
Our faces form all our needs  
The future's not returning  
All bridges built for burning  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
One day I'll just erase the tape, wave goodbye, and fade away  
Get lost in the frost again  
Clean the ashes of my face at the bottom of your suitcase  
Find a sunset, turn away  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
We walk around inside each other visiting the empty rooms  
Put me on, I'll put you on too  
You knew I'd have to follow you because you saw I'm hollow too  
But it's so nice being I too  
How can there by anything wrong?

We don't care who led us here  
No-one will care when we're gone

Thought I had this insulation  
The only way to stop the flood whenever feelings get too real  
Is to cut the information

"When I come in my dream to a house I've never seen before,  
I have a tendency to look for the exit door.  
Cause I never know it may be that house again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
When I come in my mind to a stream that's running gently,  
I have a tendency to run like a frightened deer.  
Cause I never know it may take me to that ocean again,  
I never know, I never know.  
  
I usually stay away from being carried away,  
But one day I saw a silver horse.  
I though he might take me to that somewhere high,  
I thought he might take me to that deep blue sky.  
  
I came to realize that the horse had no wings.  
""No wings, well, it wasn't so bad, you know.""  
  
I learnt to travel the world around  
And run on the ground in the morning.  
And that's the story of a wandering soul,  
A story of a dreamer.

The night that I won't forget

And everything seemed just right  
I couldn't ask for me  
But baby, I've been wrong before  
  
He used to smile at me  
And a-hold my hand like you do  
Then he left me  
And a-broke my heart in two

And feel your warm embrace

"I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know I'd lose you  
Somewhere along the way?  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile hello  
""No love like our love"", they'd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night  
I start remembering  
Everything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be  
Part of me  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That someday soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way  
Somewhere along the way

"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
I just can't remember who to send it to  
  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Won't you look down upon me, jesus  
You've got to help me make a stand  
You've just got to see me through another day  
My body's aching and my time is at hand  
And I won't make it any other way  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
  
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around  
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
  
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again, now  
  
Thought I'd see you one more time again  
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now  
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now

Is the hunger in my eyes

To slay the phantom form  
Raise the stake in malice  
You cannot plunge it down

To lie dormant

Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite  
Linked together by one trait  
The Hell-filled need to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)  
  
Emerging from their Hellish tomb  
Taking flight amidst the night  
The evening skies are raining Death  
  
Swooping down from shadowed skies  
Taking simple human form  
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  
  
Lock their jaws into your veins  
Satanic soldiers strike their prey  
Leaving corpses waiting for the change  
  
Blood dripping from the jaws of Death  
Not enough to satisfy  
They must drain your soul of life

"Thirteen times I went to the well  
To draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell  
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life  
Those that crumbled only caused me strife  
  
Thoughts became words, cast into the sea  
But they returned, always haunting me  
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore  
I just don't think I can give anymore  
  
Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?  
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?  
  
Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me  
After everything, you still want me to bleed  
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes  
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive  
  
At thirteen I started down this path  
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath  
Years of clawing at scars that never healed  
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real  
  
Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?  
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?  
  
Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me  
After everything, you still want me to bleed  
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes  
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive  
  
I can't get out, I can't jump out  
Too much to face, I can't erase

"In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown  
On the silver paper of the wrapper  
There's a dapper little man  
And he wears a wax mustache  
That he twists with nicotine fingers  
As he drops his cigarette ash  
And someone comes and sweeps it up  
And then he doffs his cap  
And there's a rat in someone's bedroom  
And they're shutting someone's trap  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces  
  
And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present  
And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.  
And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,  
Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,  
And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,  
And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.  
  
It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,  
Like a picture of Prince William in the arms of John the Pope.  
There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,  
The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.  
  
You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,  
You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.  
To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.  
  
So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,  
And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.  
And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.

Verse Three: Puff Daddy  
  
Can you feel me baby? I been away a long time  
Is it still me baby? The one on your mind  
Can we creep when everybody sleepin and find  
Ourselves 'tween satin sheets intertwined  
Can I touch you baby? Is that aight witchu?  
Can I love you baby? What we about to do  
Could make the whole earth move, I tell you my first move  
Climb up in it slow, I ain't tryin to hurt you  
Can you feel me baby? Should I keep it right there?  
Is it still me baby? Take off your night wear  
And lay your pretty body in the middle of your bed  
As I place myself in the middle of your legs  
Do you want me baby? Just let me know  
Like Aaliyah baby, and I'ma set you slow  
Get freaky baby, can you handle that?  
Dim the lights burn candles on your back, yeah

Lonely and you're never coming round  
Turnaround, every now and then I getta little bit  
Tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (all of the time)  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit

Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit  
Angry and I know I've got to get out and cry

Terrified but then I see the look in you eyes

"Down at the best spot  
Its me and JD and they sellin more birds than a pet shop  
The spot's hot and everybody nervous  
That's when the blue car served us  
Oh why did fools had to let loose  
Heard six pops from a deuce deuce  
Big Tom had to push us  
13 niggas runnin' straight to the bushes  
For they gats so they could draw down  
But why a motherfucker like me had to fall down  
Not known why I dropped out  
Fuck it, still can't afford to get popped out  
So now I gotta jet  
Only ran one block, but my shirt soakin' wet  
Tryin' to see if we got him  
Looked down at my sweatshirt red at the bottom  
Didn't panic but I still looked cracked out  
Yelled to the homies then I blacked out  
  
Woke up in the back of a tray  
On my way, to MLK  
That the county hospital jack  
Where niggas die over a little scratch  
Still sittin' in the trauma center  
In my back is where the bullet entered  
Yo nurse I'm gettin' kind of warm  
Bitch still made me fill out the fuckin' form  
Coughin' up blood on my hands and knees  
Then I heard ""freeze nigger don't move""  
Yo, I didn't do a thing  
Didn't want to go out like my man Rodney King  
Still got gaffled  
Internal bleeding as the bullet starts to travel  
Now I'm handcuffed  
Being asked information on my gang affiliation  
I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes  
And I'm a victim of neighborhood crime  
  
I need to see a MD  
And y'all motherfuckers giving me the third degree  
Look at the waiting room  
Its filled to the rim like the county jail day room  
Nobody gettin' help  
Since we poor  
The hospital move slow  
Now I'm laid out  
People steppin' over me to get closer to the tv  
Just like a piece of dog shit  
Now will I die on this nappy ass carpet  
One hour done passed  
Done watched two episodes of MASH  
And when I'm almost through  
They call my name and put me on ICU  
Halfway dead  
No respect and handcuffed to the bed  
Now the trauma starts  
'Cause the bullet must be just a hair from my heart  
So I begin the ass kissin'  
Just to get looked at by an overworked physician  
Got the chills, but my temperatures 103  
Only got a band-aid and an IV  
That's when I start cussin'  
Police steady askin' me who did the bustin'  
  
Why oh why can't I get help  
'Cause I'm black, I gots to go for self  
Too many black bodies the hospital housin'  
So at 10 P.M. I was Audi 5000

And I'll always love you  
And nobody can make me do wrong  
Take me for granted

And temptation strong

You gotta be a do right all's night man

But you can't prove that by me  
And as long as we're together

I need to sleep  
Come a long long way  
No time for weepin  
No time for weepin  
Quiet now I'm falling down  
I'm falling down  
I have heard  
A million tales  
I have told  
A million more  
Some of them  
Must have been true  
But I don't know anymore  
I'm falling down

When the wheels just seem to turn  
And uncertainties about your tomorrow seem to grow  
One thing you should remember  
And you should always know  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear every word you say  
When you cry at night  
I'll wipe the tears away  
Just pray, my love  
And I'll be there right away  
You will never have to wonder about My love  
Just put your faith and trust in My care  
I will always be there to hold you in my arms  
When you're afraid don't worry  
I'll protect you from the storm  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear

"Well I gotta funny feeling  
But I'm gonna stay cool  
Something's telling me I'm  
Gonna break all the rules  
Let me tell ya I'm not insecure  
But I gotta empty feeling  
Think that you got the cure  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
Well I'm feeling sober but I'm high on the throne  
Like a demon sick of sin and tired of being alone  
I've made a bed that's hard to lie in  
But if loving you is wrong can't do nothing but sin  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say  
  
Let them hang me, they would if they knew  
Even half the things I've been doing with you  
Walk me to the gallow and drop me to the floor  
And watch me swinging and I still want more  
  
You said it all, youve got to stay  
To proud to fall, no more to say

"It's a thin line between love and hate  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
And you're just getting in  
You knock on the front door  
And a voice sweet and low says  
""who is it?""  
She opens up the door and lets you in  
Never once asks where have you been  
She says ""are you hungry?  
Did you eat yet?  
Let me hang up your coat  
Pass me your hat""  
All the time she's smiling  
Never once raises her voice  
It's five o'clock in the morning  
You don't give it a second thought  
  
It's a thin line between love and hate  
(repeat)  
  
The sweetest woman in the world  
Could be the meanest woman in the world  
If you make her that way  
You keep hurting her  
She'll keep being quiet  
She might be holding something inside  
That'll really, really hurt you one day  
  
I see you're in the hospital  
Bandaged from foot to head  
In a state of shock  
Just that much from being dead  
You couldn't believe the girl  
Would do something like this, ha  
You didn't think the girl had the nerve  
But here you are
